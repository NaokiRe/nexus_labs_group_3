"I have no friends, but I have so many. Throwaway account. 
I am so tired of feeling consistently lonely. I have friends, but I am afraid to talk to them for fear of judgement, rejection, guilt, misunderstanding. 

I just want friends that I can say, ""I really need to self harm."" 
And have them understand what that feels like 

But guess what? I do.  I do have those friends, but I still have that want/desire. 

I have a great boyfriend, but I still feel so lonely and trapped in my own mind. 

I want to self-destruct. I have so much anger that I need to release, and I typically internalise it.  I haven't self harmed in months and I don't want to let me family down if I do. 

I just need help so much, but I always reject the help out of fear.

I’m thinking about admitting myself to the psych ward I’m having really bad episodes and I’m ruining relationships left and right. I haven’t even begun treatment for bpd because I’m still in the process of being diagnosed. I’m thinking about admitting myself to the psych ward for a week as an attempt to stop spiraling down and help get my life back on track.

"Girlfriend has BPD, need help discussing things with her.. Hey everyone, first time posting here so please excuse any errors ive made, or if its not appropriate feel free to delete the post...

My girlfriend and I had an argument over the last couple of days, she was being quite distant, and ive not experienced that from her since we've been together. So i asked her about it politely, ""i feel like you've been a little distant lately, is everything okay, i feel like ive been left in the dark"". To which she got a bit defensive and angry, things spiraled out of control a little and we had an argument over nothing.
Im trying to write her a letter currently, and im basically trying to open up to her, to let her know that i am here for her to talk to if she needs me, however im not going to force her to talk. 
Ive not dated someone with BPD before, so this is all a new experience, and im trying my hardest not to mess anything up because i really love her. Basically i have a letter written out but i want someone whos more familiar with BPD to proof read it, incase anything ive written in there comes across in the wrong way. PM me and ill happily copy paste the letter to you. its about 3 pages long though. Im not sure how much detail i should've gone into with this post but if theres any more context needed, reply to the post and ill see what i can answer. 

Thanks in advance for any help, much appreciated &lt;3 ","[[{'label': 'love', 'score': 0.4274488389492035}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.16002966463565826}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.10518858581781387}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.09572800993919373}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.08512960374355316}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.052556343376636505}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.039521731436252594}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.03205972909927368}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.028985971584916115}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.023512791842222214}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.023384569212794304}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.02136017382144928}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.02135966159403324}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.02058161422610283}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.020282624289393425}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.017701881006360054}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.01712597906589508}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.011661301366984844}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.009537536650896072}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.008501140400767326}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.004360822960734367}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.003758894046768546}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.003297325223684311}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.0032851900905370712}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.003279645461589098}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.0023796490859240294}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0006773388595320284}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.0006252719322219491}]]"
"Dealing with the loss of my life I am 31 years old and a quiet borderline. When I was a child my mother and I would have horrible fights full of swearing and screaming. As I got to be a teenager it was almost daily swearing at me and calling me all sorts of horrible things.  I would end up bawling in my room just boiling with rage at her practically every day. I never told anyone about what was going on, because I felt it was my fault for being a brat and for treating her terribly. I felt too ashamed and guilty to let anyone know, I thought they would think I was a terrible person. 

It's hard to explain to other people because trauma is easily understandable when its physical or sexual abuse, and it wasn't that with me. It was constant daily verbal abuse from my mother, and a father who was over-protective, babying, and treated me as if I was incapable of doing anything myself. The verbal abuse from my mother would make me feel so out of control, so small, so helpless. I would fantasize about killing her all the time. My mother would always tell me I was a horrible person, and though I would tell myself she was wrong, her belief eventually seeped inside me. I hated myself so much. I have never allowed myself to think a positive thought, or feel a moment of joy, because when I do, I would feel a huge torrent of guilt and self hate come over me.

I was an outgoing child with friends in elementary school, but when I entered middle school my friends rejected me, started bullying me. That’s the point in my life where I totally imploded. Everyone in my life hated me and treated me as inferior. I wasn’t safe with anyone. I don’t know if anyone has seen the movie Get Out, but that’s the moment that I went into the Sunken Place and never came out. I have never been able to be comfortable around anyone, I am stiff and fake.  Interacting with people is just constant paranoia. In high school I tried to put on a fake smile to the world, but my peers could sense my insecurity and no one liked me. 

My way of coping became to dissociate, and I've been dissociated for 20 years. I’ve spent the last 20 years mostly on the internet, living in a fantasy world to distract me from loneliness. I have also engaged in very unhealthy binge eating. I have always known in the back of my mind that I am punishing myself. Punishing myself for treating my mom badly. Even though I know this is irrational, I have not been able to stop the feelings that cause this behavior, and then the behavior itself. Words cannot describe how it feels to be stuck in the sunken place, aware of everything you are doing but unable to stop yourself, pounding on the walls and screaming to stop, as you watch yourself waste and ruin your entire life, and destroy your health and appearance. 

I am now a 31 year old “adult"". Or so I appear to be to other people. I am supposed to have a lifetime of experiences under my belt. I haven’t experienced anything at all. I never ever had any friends. I’ve never kissed anyone. Never been to a party. Never held someone at night. Never danced. Never giggled, been silly, or had a moment of fun.  I graduated college, but only spent one semester on campus and didn’t make any friends or have any experiences. I never grew up at all. 

 I look “mature”, probably older than my age, but I am really still an insecure 16 year old. i have a lot of white hairs, due to poor sleep, long periods of inactivity, stress and poor diet. My face looks very serious and lined, and my soft attractive skin and hair is gone. I still live with my parents, and the negative relationship, though it’s less explosive, still affects me. I have had a series of minimum wage customer service jobs that are a nightmare because I am terrible at them, incompetent and can’t remember anything. The social aspect of these jobs with the co-workers also go terribly and it’s a nightmare to be in them. 

Now that I’ve lost most of my life, my entire youth, and ruined my appearance, and perhaps my health since I’ve recently developed knee and other problems, I can feel myself coming into reality more, less dissociated, less in the fantasy world. The loss of my life is too great. Too horrible to comprehend. I cannot accept it. It can’t be reality. I had so many dreams. I can still feel them, taste them.  So many things I wanted to experience and achieve.  I do not see anything positive to look forward to in my future. I am especially upset about the loss of my physical appearance and body. My body does not produce the sorts of hormones that make for that youthful exuberance or romance I always dreamed of anymore. 

Part of the self punishment I engaged in was to make myself physically unattractive through bad eating and lack of exercise. I know some people don’t care a lot about appearance and view it as a shallow concern, but it has always been important to me. I’ll never get to experience the kind of sensuality that comes from being attractive and young anymore. My skin disgusts me, it’s grizzled and old. I can’t see anyone I’m attracted to being attracted to me, and even if they were, sex and romance is ruined by the changes in my appearance. This *tortures* me. 

Even if I grabbed life by the reins now, it wouldn't make up for what's lost. All I can see in my future is deep disappointment and sadness. It is too horrible for me to comprehend and face. I don't know what to do. 

**TL;DR**  Trauma from my childhood set me on a path of self-punishment that involved hiding myself away from the world and people, dissociating into a fantasy world on the internet, and self-destructive and unhealthy binge eating habits. At 31, I have not lived any life, had any experiences, and I've ruined my physical appearance and possibly my health. That I've lost my life is too horrible for me to comprehend or accept. Even if I grabbed life by the reins now, it wouldn't make up for what's lost. All I can see in my future is disappointment and deep deep sadness. I don't know what to do.","The expanded size of the tensor (1399) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.  Target sizes: [1, 1399].  Tensor sizes: [1, 514]"

"My mother found me after I overdosed and left me there I'm a 19 year old former uni student. I dropped out of studying for a degree in manufactured engineering just before christmas. I moved out of the city I'd lived in these past 4 years and moved back in with my mother.

We argued a lot, or to be more accurate I'd piss her off by not realising x thing needed doing (because she wouldn't say anything, just silently fume) and she'd yell at me. Tell me I'm disgusting, lazy, not mentally ill, dirty, vile. She told me, a borderline personality sufferer, that I'm a manipulator. That I use people... that I'm a train of self destruction that hurts everyone in my life and leaves them.

She's been this way all my life, and started saying this stuff to me when I was around 10. I finally realise that she doesn't actually believe these statements, rather she remembers things I've mentioned. She knows I'm scared of becoming a user and she decides to hurl it at me because she knows it'll hurt me. She says statements knowing that it'll hurt, and when I cry she raises her voice, then yells about me acting like a baby by crying. She takes enjoyment out of belittling me when she's hurt by something that I've accidentally done.

So christmas eve I took a overdose of dihydrocodeine and amitriptyline. I took about 15 pills each. I began to fall asleep whilst eating pizza in the evening. My mother kept shouting me and asking me ""how can you sleep sitting up?"". I could still respond at this point but in a slurred way, saying I was just very tired.

I went to bed. My mother promised me that she would wake me in 20 minutes, so it'd be a nap as it was only 6pm ish. My last memory is sitting on my bed as she promised me she'd wake me.

I woke at 3am with no memory of what I'd done, hallucinating. Every time I'd close my eyes I'd see something, and when I opened them I'd see even more disturbing things. I have hallucinations due to BPD so it didn't disturb me too much.

I woke my mother up around 11am christmas day with a coffee. Later in the day I began remembering what had happened, my overdose and asked her if she tried to wake me. She looked at me and said ""I tried, you wouldn't wake up. I shook and pulled you and you carried on asleep. So you overdosed?"". I admitted it. She just nodded. She didn't look upset or angry or even empty or defeated, just mildly annoyed. I asked her why she didn't phone an ambulance. She just said I was still breathing.

My life has gone into shambles. I sleep on my mothers fold up bed in the hallway of her one bedroom flat. I have no friends, no purpose, nothing. I live with a soul destroying mental illnesses which leaves me on the verge of abusing people regularly, and in an effort to not hurt people I hurt myself through cutting and burning and using drugs and alcohol, and have done for nearly 10 years.

I am heavily scarred, most are keloid. Red and purple and silver keloid scarring, raised and dents in my skin, all over from my arms to my breasts to my legs. I pissed myself the other month because the prescription painkillers, the constant use for years have done something to my bladder. I suffer with stomach pains due to the amount of pills I regularly take. I have no job, and considering the fact I can't even talk to people without stuttering and struggle to do basic things like go to the supermarket or talk to strangers it's no easy feat to get a job. Still I had a volunteer job at my old city, but I live too far away now.

I'm broken, finally broken, and my own mother left me knowing I could die, because only a stupid person can walk on somebody unconscious and unable to wake and decide that theres zero chance that person will die.

"It wont stop. I have very little patience for anyone anymore. I don't trust anyone and my views on others are warped to the point where any interaction in real life with someone I'm completely dead inside because I have always been isolated and alone with my intense thoughts and feelings. 

I've learnt overtime people just don't care and allowed myself to be slowly buried into a pit of expressing myself less and less. I'll hide and never reach out, because every time I do I get nothing other than finding out I was lied to, manipulated or they'll never care as much as I do.

I grew up with an unstable family full of abuse. I wasn't brought up right and I've never known how to interact with others properly. I was always bullied in school by other girls and I've been beaten up multiple times. I had no security growing up and while I'm an adult now I feel like I'm slowly fading away.

"Having a really rough time. Just need to vent. Just want to preface, that I have no idea how to express myself and I hope this makes sense.

Little back story. I was diagnosed with BPD at 19, but of course being the iamverysmart teenager that I was, I rejected the diagnosis along with PTSD. Fast forward to recently, I've been seeing a therapist and psychiatrist to help treat depression. I stumbled across this subreddit and /r/BPDmemes and couldn't help but really relate to what I've read. To some degree I don't want to accept that maybe just maybe the doctor was right after all. I do plan to discuss this with her at our next appointment.

Which brings me to today. I can feel my depression sneaking in on me, but I know what triggered it. I tried to discuss my past diagnosis with my husband, and how I was currently feeling very lonely. His reaction was less than supportive to say the least. I feel like I'm just burdening him even more than I already have. I feel like he hates me, or at least doesn't like me very much. I feel like he wishes I was out of his life. Whatever the reason is, he just won't talk to me about it. At the same time, I don't know if I'm losing my mind. Am I wrong for wanting to discuss this? Have I done something wrong to justify this response? I just don't know. All I know is that I'm currently hiding in the bathroom crying trying to get this out.

I don't know. I'm sorry. Thanks for reading.","[[{'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.5459513068199158}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.3180341422557831}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.1924988180398941}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.12647616863250732}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.10594850778579712}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.10069802403450012}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.04812922328710556}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.03182132914662361}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.03130123019218445}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.0276417825371027}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.02702096477150917}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.02096790261566639}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.017671527341008186}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.016515765339136124}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.0154290571808815}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.010948970913887024}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.010336538776755333}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.009062844328582287}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.007765898946672678}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.007599289529025555}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.006363694090396166}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.0041137682273983955}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.0030245680827647448}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.0029237098060548306}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.002757723443210125}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0025722377467900515}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.0015988118248060346}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.0009534726850688457}]]"
Pregnant in UK Hello all. I am looking for some advice regarding accessing services particularly in the UK. I am nearly 4 months pregnant and my mental health has been getting worse since being pregnant but it has always been sketchy. I am single as my partner of 6 years left me and I’m struggling to accept this I feel like actually stabbing him to death but then I just want him to see me again. I can not control my emotions and I end up being abusive to medical staff verbally but more to Myself like head banging and wanting to kill myself because I’m a horrible person. I do compulsively text phone and bang on front door of my ex. My midwife suggested to refer me but I’m terrified they will involve social services and then my baby will be taken. Does any one have experiences of being pregnant with bpd Thank you,"[[{'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.39344102144241333}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.3269578516483307}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.32490187883377075}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.205391064286232}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.1117628663778305}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.0715980976819992}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.05841797962784767}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.031052246689796448}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.026909423992037773}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.026859745383262634}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.026273934170603752}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.01593431644141674}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.015773171558976173}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.01576261967420578}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.015532401390373707}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.014745866879820824}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.014053336344659328}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.013518743216991425}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.013041365891695023}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.012704824097454548}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.01028808206319809}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.00887643825262785}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.008582855574786663}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.007654153276234865}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.007270823698490858}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.006903837900608778}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.0028735019732266665}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.0018760953098535538}]]"

"Almost Done With IOP... Here's What I've Learned A few months ago I was frequenting this sub while waiting for my Intensive Outpatient Program for DBT to begin. Once the program started, my entire world ended (check my post history if you care, not getting into it here). I graduate the program on Thursday,  and here's what I've learned so far.

1. This sub is not helpful for recovery. While it *feels* better in the moment to bitch and get it out, that doesn't solve anything and this entire subreddit is toxic to recovery. I'm NOT saying this subreddit is bad - because it is not! - and it totally serves its purpose, but if you genuinely want to get better, this is not the place to do it.

2. Group engagement seems to be the only way to truly learn and use the skills gained in DBT. While self teaching may be the only option for some and is probably better than nothing, our perceptions are quite distorted and we really need someone to guide us and help answer our questions.

3. You are the only person that can make yourself feel better. Don't ruin someone else's life because you feel shitty about yourself and want someone else to make you feel some level of worth.

4. Radical Acceptance ... sounds like a simple concept, is much harder to put into practice, but once you do life is so much more clear. Life happens and there isn't shit you can do about it alot of the time. You can either be upset by it, or accept it. Acceptance does not mean agreement! 

5. Expectations will always lead to disappointment and resentment. Do you expect someone to console you when you're sad? And what happens when they don't? We cannot expect anything from anyone for any reason. We can only have expectations for ourselves, for that is all we have any control over.

There's tons more but these were the biggest things for me.

I appreciate this sub for all the times I felt like I needed to vent.

"Guy I was talking to for a year just ghosts me and I’m panicking and can’t get over it I was talking to a guy seriously for over a year. He got distant a few times but then came back. In September he went to rehab, I know he’s back but I haven’t heard from him since then. 
I have texted him excessively, I’m really embarrassed and I think he’s blocked my number. 
I’m so embarrassed and sad, I don’t understand why he’s doing this to me, he knows I have had issues but so has he. 

He unfollowed me on Instagram and won’t accept my follow request, it’s just sitting there unaccepted 

He doesn’t even open my snap messages. 

I can’t call him and I don’t understand why he’s doing this. I know I can do better but it hurts me a lot.

"Dealing with heart break with BPD I need some advice because the emotional pain I'm feeling right now is so intense I don't know how to deal with it. I've been through break ups before, they're never easy but most have not hurt this much.
For context: I'm a young woman that's been dealing with BPD for a few years now. About a year ago, I got out of a very emotionally abusive relationship. I avoided dating for a while because it destroyed my trust in people. I met someone a few months ago who I instantly felt at home with. I pushed him away at first because I didn't want to deal with the pain all over again, but he didn't give up on me and we were very happy together. Then on christmas eve he dumps me with no explanation. Not a particularly fun situation for anyone to be in, but with BPD it's even worse these emotions are so intense and I don't know how to not go back to unhealthy coping mechanisms.

"I have realized that I’m in hell As in this is actual hell in a very literal, non-metaphorical sense. Maybe in a metaphysical sense. Trial by fire or outright torture? For 30+ years now I’ve pushed forward, isolated completely. There was no help when I was younger, especially not for males. Now I struggle with every aspect of life, not for lack of trying again, and again, and again. I am a joke or a threat to neurotypicals, and a shame to my family. Typical BPD reaction to blast all this on the internet in a moment of weakness, but the joke is I’ve been on the internet since 1995 and probably have spoken less than 10 pages of text to anybody ever. This last outing was just as demeaning as all the other attempts to break out of my shell, so here’s goes one last futile attempt to collect my fractured thoughts into a cohesive collection. I’ve always believed the way out is through, but the deeper into hell I get the more I’m looking at the emergency exit. “The easy way out” hah, well easier than 40 more years of this shit I suppose. The only question I keep wondering is if i do it, does it all just end (yes please if only), or do I just get reborn into a new, more twisted hell? Can’t help but feel like the latter is the true reality. Is my reality just this stupid dumb reality? Is everybody else the real reality? Anyways, sorry for this meaningless wall of text, for those of you that read it. I know this sub is supposed to be a safe space for venting thoughts, or at least I’m hoping so. I hold so much of this shit inside because nobody wants to hear it, and the little that leaks out always makes people hate me for not just “getting over it”. I’m tired and worn out so going to go sulk in my pity party now, but thanks for providing a space for me to shuffle my thoughts out into the great void, where they can be swallowed by the abyss.

"Sexual abuse - 11 years on, I'm no longer ashamed, I'm enraged Trigger warning: discussion of sexual violence

I have a lot of problems. It was because I had so many problems that I came across so many predators as a young girl. These assaults happened and I was told I was a slut, and I believed them. Even when I grew older and gained more knowledge, I felt like a dirty piece of garbage. I stayed silent and now there's no chance I could lay criminal charges against these monsters because I was made to believe it was my fault. My faultiness. But each year since these crimes, I have learned more and more that I'm not at fault. I was a victim. I knew this intellectually, but not emotionally until now. Now that I've been talked down to and demonised for showing my trauma. People close to me have made me feel like my behaviour is crazy, but they have no idea of my history and I'm fucking tired of it. My own boyfriend can't even listen to my history because it makes HIM feel uneasy that the world can be a meaninglessly cruel and incredibly painful place. I'm tired of protecting people, including my attackers and abusers. It just hit me emotionally - this wasn't my fault. The abuse wasn't my fault and the trauma that followed wasn't my fault. I'm tired of hiding the scars on my wrists, I tried to kill myself no less than a month after I was stone cold raped. I was raped and no fault of mine can justify that. That has hit me emotionally. The shame was stifling and choking the justifiable fucking rage of someone who has been wronged. I'm tired of everyone in my life dismissing this and dismissing my pain. Why should I be alone as a victim of crime and someone with a mental illness? People who are mugged or frauded are afforded some fucking sympathy. People with cancer are afforded some understanding. I'm tired of the shame I've carried for this.

My sister put a little review on FB about how wonderful her year has been. And i am so so so proud of her, she really deserves all the lovely things. But that made me realise that i dont have any ""good"" things that happend ~ or that i actively did ~ this year.

"im scared of turning out like my mom i recently found out that my mom is an abusive narcissist who has been playing me my whole life and is the reason i was sexually abused as a child.  she almost allowed my teenage sister to be beaten and raped by her new husband but i was able to intervene and stop her from being in the same situation i was in.  the thing is that every resource i can find about narcissistic parenting also says that bpd is very similar, and children of narcissistic abusive parents turn out to have bpd and become abusive themselves.  i dont want this.  im afraid im a bad person just because of this.  im also afraid of accepting the uncomfortable truths that my friends will always be closer to each other than they are to me because of how i am, no matter how much i care about them and put them on a pedestal, and that i will never love as much as i love others, which is something ive learned from a lot of posts here.  i just dont know what to do.  i dont know how i can live like this or if i even should, if im going to turn out just like my mother.","[[{'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.8868756294250488}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.13942405581474304}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.04146801680326462}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.04035082086920738}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.03949994593858719}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.03935897722840309}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.020698847249150276}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.02033848501741886}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.018237048760056496}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.01713544689118862}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.016767611727118492}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.015521153807640076}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.015476749278604984}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.013422772288322449}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.01239566970616579}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.008114923723042011}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.006531162653118372}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.00607015285640955}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.005582817830145359}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.005553531460464001}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.005540934391319752}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.005163675639778376}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.004510514438152313}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.003766288748010993}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.0026148143224418163}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.0023531781043857336}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.0020005162805318832}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.001498885452747345}]]"
"Progesterone only pill was my one temporary hope and it hasn't helped I went on Cerazette just over a month ago having read that it could be good for BPD, and having discussed my 'PMS weeks of hell' each month - where I fly dangerously close to accidentally killing myself - with the nurse. 

However, this past week I've been completely nuts again, crying for no reason, drinking more than usual, self-harming almost daily, causing arguments with my boyfriend for no reason, wondering why I'm even with him, constant suicidal/delusional/paranoid thoughts - all backwards stuff. Then what do you know - I'm on my period now and the rotting feeling in my chest and the tightness in my stomach is all but gone. 

But it didn't work, it was supposed to quell the crazy. Has anyone taken antidepressants for this exact reason? I can usually control my symptoms enough to avoid meds but enough is enough.

"BPD with other personality disorders So I have been diagnosed with BPD as well as dependent PD and Histrionic PD. 

I personally find that they all overlap. 
I attach to people and feel like I have to have their approval for everything I do (DPD) then anytime I feel like I'm losing them or they are upset, I resort to the whole, I'm going g to kill myself (BPD) so you will care for (DPD) and love me again.
I also feel as though the HPD is linked with my self harm as attention seeking but I am unsure.
I've been very confused with that diagnosis because I'm not provocative but I always want people attention and will dress weird so people notice me blah blah blah.

Anywho.. i was wondering if anyone else has been diagnosed with other personality disorders and how they interact and overlap with your BPD.

"Happy New Year's everybody I am spending this new year's alone, but I  not upset about it. I have not felt well, so I am cuddled up on the couch with my new cat, Moby. A warm steam vaporizer on the floor. Cold water galore. Dayquil. NyQuil. Cough drops. Basically a pharmacy. I'm watching Ash vs Evil Dead on Netflix. Scary movies and TV shows are far less scary than real life. 

I've made progress in 2017. It was a shitty year, but it wasn't my worst. I've made it through worse and will continue to push through. 2018 is a year of many new things. A new semester. A new counselor. A new place to escape from home.

"Happy New Year! It gets better. Hello! 2016 was the absolute worst year of my life. I lost all my friends and felt very alone, etc. I thought life would never get better and I would be utterly miserable forever.

2017 was better. Am I completely happy? No. Do I magically have tons of friends and got rid of my BPD? No. But it was better than 2016. I’m happier. I’m healthier. I’m more content with myself and spending time with myself and working on me. I honestly don’t know if I would be diagnosed with BPD at this point (haven’t been to therapy in almost 2 years so this is just a guess). 

I’m 23 now and I just wanted to encourage you to give it time. You might not ever be completely fixed but I KNOW it will get better. Give it some time, focus on yourself, and I encourage you to put yourself first and remove people from your life that don’t help you stay in a good mental state. It’s hard and 2017 included a lot of alone time working on myself and learning to be content.

"How does one develop a thicker skin? Hello, at work I am pathologically nervous about being perceived as not a good teacher. I teach in a very low income, gang infested area. I get very good test scores, the parents like me, the kids love me, I have great classroom management, good reviews, etc.  But I'm at a new school with a new principal. She or her assistant are always in my room critiquing and saying I need to do this or that instead of doing what I know gets good test scores (this is 3rd grade, and the whole school's ""rating"" depends on my 3rd grade scores). She put me in 3rd grade because of my good track record with scores (and more importantly, teaching struggling readers how to read), but now she's buzzing around me so much that I am freaking out.

At my other school I was always on the verge of a nervous breakdown, but this year at this new school I actually did have a nervous breakdown.  I had literally been getting 2 hours of sleep a night because I'm trying to please my new principal. Then I became suicidal and was in the psych ward because this pushed me over the edge.

Now I am so nervous when they come in my room, and really 24 hours a day, because I'm trying to conform to what they want me to do. 

How do people not get nervous about these kind of things? Other teachers just let it roll off their backs.

""Why are you speaking to me rudely?"" ""Stop yelling at me"" and it enrages me so much because i feel she is making it all about her and its fucking not its because im angry and upset and im not suddenly going to calm down just to answer her. I end up always yelling at her saying shit like ""Stop making it about you"" ""you think everything is about you"" etc and then we'll storm off.

"Don’t know what to do anymore Tired of being such a fuck up and having nobody around that can understand why besides a therapist I only see once a week. It just keeps getting worse. Days spent just numbing myself with anything I possibly can and no amount of drugs or self harm seem to do anything anymore at the same time yet I can’t stop this cycle of self destructing when part of me still wants to slowly kill myself. Why am I this fucked in the head? Sorry, if this makes no sense at all to anyone. I’m currently in tears due to my boyfriend basically blaming me for my BPD. He says I have no right to blame others but I DO blame myself more than anyone else for it. I guess somehow he just can’t see it. Is it really my fault that I have a disorder that literally makes me hate myself? I haven’t been able to eat all day. I feel sick. I can’t do anything. I just want to disappear and waste away.

"There are some people that would like for you to accept that you are flawed; it fits their narrative. Don't let them pigeonhole you, they are simply doing this because it reduces the difficulty for them in dealing with you. It also has the very negative effect of making you feel like a piece of garbage, and worse, someone that is forever limited by their shortcomings.

What I have found, is that although BPD does come with its challenges, you are who you are. All of those complexities and possibly even malevolent thoughts are your strengths if you make them that, you must acknowledge the nasty parts of yourself in order to realize your full capacity. If you shove them down and hide from them, they only have more control over you, just how these people in your life would like it to be (not that they want you to suffer, but again, because you are diminished it simplifies their understanding of you). 

Edit: Your anecdotal experience has nothing to do with the fact this is a real thing that happens to people with disorders, people do categorize them.

So many emotions I honestly really want to die. I always think that I’m never going to actually do it but I feel like I will soon. I’m losing health insurance. My car was totaled. Everybody just says that I shouldn’t complain because at least I don’t have cancer. And my therapist doesn’t understand. I have so much anger and emotions I’m seeing blurry. I want to end it now. I don’t even feel alive I feel like I’m fading in and out of reality. I asked my therapist for another screening well a new one to see if I have something else but no of course there is no need for a screening because I’m just looking for attention. I don’t thinking wanting to kill my self and others is normal. I don’t think hearing people and seeing weird things is normal. I’m so done with people and everybody not listening.,"[[{'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.39242422580718994}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.33015140891075134}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.20395995676517487}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.07226214557886124}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.062097784131765366}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.04726353660225868}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.027675818651914597}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.018070178106427193}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.009768033400177956}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.009640123695135117}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.008824219927191734}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.008356110192835331}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.006602919660508633}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.005090234335511923}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.005022524390369654}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.004056205973029137}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.004052582196891308}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.0038886615075170994}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0034565688110888004}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.0032594753429293633}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.0026560539845377207}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.0020718055311590433}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.002054825657978654}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.0018555836286395788}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.0012110508978366852}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.0009484296897426248}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.0006209701532498002}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.0004959687939845026}]]"

"Looking for some Options Hello,

I've decided to stop taking my medication 5 weeks ago. I was registered in my local hospital's outpatient program. The psychiatrist I was seeing would spare me ten minutes every two months. After he changed some medications and made me severely manic I had to defer quite a bit of school assignments and exams. I ended up in the hospital on exam day. 

I decided to be discharged from his care and seek another option, who was a severe downgrade from my original.

Now I'm out of options, and unmedicated. I finally have health insurance and I'm not too sure where to go from here. 

I couldn't attend the 8 month waiting list DBT program due to a class schedule conflict. I try my best to advocate for myself but I can tell that my mental health is very sporadic and I'm worried that I'll fail out of school. I live in ON, Canada.

I should also mention I have no recollection of the past few months...it just kind of happened, and it still just happening.

"Could REALLY use some advice. Hey,

looking for some advice  on how others deal with this problem.

I just got back from England from a small vacation/time off and it was great I was with 6 friends there and I loved it, but I always have this issue where I don't appreciate it at the moment itself but always afterwards and I have this with pretty much everything in my life, iam so scared im going have this at my deathbed. My life is great, I got a loving family, pretty good friends and a nice job and yet I dont appreciate it as I should and the worst thing is. I know of the problem and yet I got no clue on how to solve it. Also I have this stupid retarded issue in my head where I can't buy anything nice for myself or the people closes to me but I can buy something nice and really expensive for someone meh/I barely see or are not that close to me and again I know of it but I don't know how to deal with it.

Also I have no Idea who I actually am, im really into politics and history and im pretty conservative and complain alot about the current state of society  and yet. I had in total 7 escorts come over, and 2 of them I developed feelings for within a F**king hour. What is wrong with me. Worst thing is I dont even know why im doing it cause I don't even enjoy the sex or anything. I have this really big hatred/dislike for hypocrisie and yet I seem to be the BIGGEST one.

When I was in England, a friend of mine her Niece picked us up and sometimes hang out with us. She is a very friendly sweet girl but I know she is nothing for me but everytime I fall inlove/get feelings for her BUT! Again I know she is NO match for me and I still fall in love I feel like im not in control at all. 

I cut myself on my arm and although I do it to keep myself sane, I keep finding myself positioning my cuts in such a way that they are not very visible but still visible enough to notice(only when I want to/certain people). In the hope someone sees them and helps me out, I think this is a disguisting trait of myself and again I know of it but keep doing it. 

Also I find my self image to be very changing, one moment I look at myself and think well okay thats okay/could be worse. And other times im completely disgusted by myself and truly hate how I look, I cant even look in mirrors sometimes. 

I also know I need to take action to actually try and get a girl yet im extremely passive and have no idea how to talk to women in a not just friends way, im also super super blind to flirting. Alot of times I hear friends say dude she was flirting with you and I honestly had no Idea at all, I just see someone acting friendly. Again I complain to friends that I miss a girl who is their for me and I know the problem yet I dont do anything about it. 

I have no damn clue who I am and where the hell I stand for, I have really strong opinions on things and yet I find myself betraying my own morales. 

I just have no idea how to express it, I can seriously cry my eyes out and go freaking mental and lets say that in the middle of that A friend comes by and asks how you doing in a sincere way I cant bring myself to say it. Even If i want to I just CANT get the words out.

Why can't I just tell my parents they are amazing and that I love them, but why CAN I tell a female (just a friend) who helped me out once. Why can I text her a bible text that Im thankful and that I pretty much swear my allegiance to her. Again Im aware but I dont know how to fix it.

One moment depressed and one moment the party maker, and no I have not seeked for help yet cause every time I did I cant seem to express myself or finding myself able to not be honest/cant get the mask off. 

I think im losing my mind and im so sorry if this text is a complete mess but Its very rare for me to actually express/write down how I feel, if you have any advice I would be super thankful.

If you have any questions feel free to ask, sorry for the grammar and sorry if its very dramatic but I honestly have no other way to describe it. 

For the record I'm 22 Male. 

Thank you all so much, even if youre only reading this. ","The expanded size of the tensor (986) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.  Target sizes: [1, 986].  Tensor sizes: [1, 514]"
"I wonder if I'd feel lonely even in the afterlife? I'm so lonely. I'm absolutely terrified of reaching out and asking for any kind of human contact, wether it'd be a hug from my mom or asking a girl I met on tinder to meet up.

"Are SO's treated differently? I hope this is the correct sub for this question.

Looking back at my recently ended long term relationship with my BPD ex-girlfriend has given me some questions.  She ended things about 30 days ago but has since started cautiously talking to me again.  That part isn't my question. 

My question.  From what I've been able to see and from watching her reactions with friends, family and her children.  It seems I was the target of the brunt of her anger.  She would  misinterpret a simple comment or anything I said that she took as criticism and would become very angry, and hurt.  Even repeated attempts to explain what I meant never worked.  She would seem stuck on the initial comment.  I've never seen her do that to any other person.   

Example:. What caused our break up of 8 years.  She was telling me how tired she was.  I validated her comments by telling her anyone would be exhausted doing all the things you've been dining.  Then I added. A good night's sleep can do wonders. She blew up despite my attempts to say it was a comment made because I cared and understood she was tired.  The next day she sent me a text.  I'm not happy with you or this relationship since the beginning.  I'm done.  End of text.  Blocked on all social media and everything else.

Is it common to lash out and be more critical of your SO?  To pay more attention to everything they say?

"BPD Siblings...can’t get along?? Hi Everyone,

So I’m a diagnosed BPD’er and my brother is (what I believe) is an undiagnosed person with BPD. 

We can’t seem to get along. And with my Mom being so sick he will be the only family that I have left. Just an FYI...he lives in the upstairs suite with his family and I live in the downstairs suite with the Mom, who I take care of. 

It seems that he is unable to give any amount of empathy in any situation. When discussing anything to do with feelings...he comes across as cold and distant...either that or inappropriately angry to the point of rage.  This is in direct contrast to myself, who is overly empathetic and quite often likes to discuss feelings. (Maybe this is also a bit of a gender thing??). 

I have been noticing that I split on him every week or so over something he says or does/doesn’t do. From my point of view he doesn’t care if he has any type of relationship with me at all...which hurts. 

Is there a different way I can go about this?? He will not get help...doesn’t believe he has issues and doesn’t believe in mental health treatment. So...I guess the onus is on me to change. I want so bad to connect with him as he will be my only remaining family but I have no idea how to get along with him. 

I know I’ve read some of your posts about being unable to be empathetic...I guess I really have a hard time understanding this. 

I’m rambling now. Any comments, thoughts or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!!

Thanks!!","[[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.2856692671775818}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.1931724101305008}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.17741580307483673}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.10178053379058838}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.09679470211267471}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.04262436926364899}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.033519819378852844}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.028226200491189957}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.025704992935061455}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.02315789833664894}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.019607914611697197}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.018433542922139168}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.01692855730652809}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.014209061861038208}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.0077662779949605465}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.006356552708894014}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.00443976791575551}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.004420451354235411}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.0042988816276192665}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.003933706786483526}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.003685154253616929}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.00275780213996768}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.0026653010863810778}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0019229569006711245}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.0018627491081133485}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.0016925063682720065}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.0005526964669115841}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.0005155619001016021}]]"
"I shared my story and something wonderful happened. Would you mind sharing your story? I'm cross-posting this from /r/BipolarReddit because BPD was not yet ruled out (diagnosed with Bipolar 1). But this subreddit and the other have been incredibly helpful for me in coping, and the relationship challenges addressed here are something that continue to hit very close to home.

December was a very difficult month for me, and this subreddit became a sanctuary during some especially hard moments. So first of all - thank you to all of you. You have helped me to realize I am not alone in this.

As a sort of therapy for myself, I shared a video of my recent challenges on Facebook. I felt completely vulnerable and almost removed it. But then responses of love and encouragement began pouring in. It was empowering and brought me a sense of hope I haven't had in a while.

People from all parts of my life began private messaging me, sharing their own stories of mental health challenges.

I realized that talking openly about my challenges is very helpful to me in the start of the journey to management. I invite you to [hear my story](https://www.facebook.com/tommygeoco/posts/10212173351023813?pnref=story) and share your own story in the comments below.

What kind of challenges are you currently facing? How far have you come? What are you suffering from right now?

I begin a DBT partial in-patient program on January 16th, and I'm trying to make it through every day leading up to that date.

Thank you again for everything this subreddit has provided in allowing me to pursue self-love and a sense of peace. It's a long road, I'm told, but today I feel present and capable.

Side note: I've been listening and re-listening to an audiobook called [Calming the Emotional Storm](https://www.audible.com/pd/Self-Development/Calming-the-Emotional-Storm-Audiobook/B01AH7EERA) in place of music lately, and just listening to the voice of the narrator and practicing a coping method here and there has been tremendously helpful for me.

"Does anyone have any uplifting thoughts or moments they would like to share? Maybe some difficulty you thought you would never overcome but did, or feeling you thought would never go away but you have moved past and what helped you? I’m sitting in my new therapists office, about a half hour early. Last therapist I met with referred me to her within 15 mins of talking to me because she wanted me to see someone who specifically offered DBT. I am excited but also incredibly nervous and scared. I’m in one of those moods where you feel like you’re a normal person and previous overreactions/suicidality was just you being dramatic and that you have control and see that now.

 I know this is fleeting. I can go from feeling completely sane and in control to spiraling quickly in my head from something as simple as reading a text message and interpreting it wrong. Sometimes it’s hard because I don’t know what I would tell a therapist because I often forget how strong my feelings were the other day, or how much I cried and the strange things I said.

"I'm going back to therapy soon and I'm wondering whether or not to tell the new therapist I think I might have BPD? I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety (generalized and social) about five years ago now, but I think BPD might better explain some of my symptoms. I was under 18 when I was diagnosed with those things, so I couldn't have been diagnosed with BPD even if the psychologist suspected it. Anyway. I've been doing a lot of research (I know that's not always great, but... idk) and BPD does seem to fit. I don't know if it's best to tell her what I think or let her reach the conclusion herself. The problem is, therapy is expensive, and I'd like to start making progress as soon as possible. So I don't want to waste months waiting for her to reach a conclusion I could be giving her now. I also worry that, if I tell her I think it's BPD, she might decide it isn't just because I've said it is and she wants to be the one to come up with the answer herself. If that makes sense. Idk if she'd do that or not; I've never met her. Alternatively, I might not have BPD at all. But I'd rather know that for sure. 


Do any of you have experience with this? Any advice about how to proceed? Should I go to the first session and gage the situation and then maybe tell her in the second one instead? 


I should note that I'm not *trying* to be diagnosed with BPD. I think it might explain some things about me, but it's fine with me if I don't actually have it. I just want to know so I can either move on or deal with it accordingly. 


Thanks :) ","[[{'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.7303752303123474}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.3246776759624481}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.08543888479471207}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.08260142803192139}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.043956805020570755}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.04177035763859749}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.03631403669714928}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.033663030713796616}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.029574930667877197}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.02726695127785206}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.016405340284109116}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.01562188658863306}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.014727949164807796}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.014147771522402763}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.013704628683626652}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.012845262885093689}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.01232781819999218}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.012235729955136776}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.010956983081996441}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.009162407368421555}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.00595241179689765}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.005405107978731394}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.004592771176248789}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.002950625726953149}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.0022951848804950714}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.002064661355689168}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.0016830874374136329}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.0011036037467420101}]]"
"No Relationships = Progress? I just realized the only time I've ever made any progress with my behavioural/identity/self-esteem issues is when I cut off contact with almost everyone in my life. I talked to my Dad and people at work but, other than that, it was very minimal contact. I found I was really coming into myself. It was when I started reintroducing relationships and sharing feelings with others that I crumbled ten times harder than before. It almost makes me wonder if I'd be happier on my own with just my family. Any thoughts or similar experiences? 

I need to add that this isn't a negative post. I was truly happy when I was alone. For the first time ever.

"sorry Honestly, I cannot bear to read any of the posts here because everything is so... everything. its all too spot on, all too real, all too overwhelming, everything. 

I just recently got diagnosed with BPD. lol is diagnosed even the proper term for this? 

I don't know what to do, and even if I see a ""happy result/ending"" here, I know it won't necessarily apply to me. And if its a bad one, then that doesn't help. And saying that it'll get better or keep your head up, or keep going or that someone else will come around, or anything at all, will not help. 

so honestly there is no point in me really posting this but I don't really know coz here I am anyway.

"how can I help my boyfriend when he is splitting? Hi guys,

my boyfriend has BPD. We've been together for a year. He sometimes splits on me and I use validation and empathy to talk through the issue. It works quite well but leaves me emotionally drained as I have to ignore the hurtful things he says to me. I was wondering whether you had any specific tips for loved ones when you are splitting on them, things that work in calming you down/seeing that you're splitting.

He's not in therapy unfortunately so he does not recognise his behaviour until afterwards (sometimes) and he then feels like shit. I've given up trying to get him to go as it creates conflict. He knows he has a problem  and he wants to change but he's very wary of therapists. I feel like at one point I'm gonna be too exhausted to continue.

Any help welcome.","[[{'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.4708939790725708}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.32480090856552124}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.14900769293308258}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.11388701945543289}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.09683743864297867}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.0609278567135334}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.03176693618297577}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.031359802931547165}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.028042621910572052}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.02034939080476761}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.02032584697008133}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.01926209218800068}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.016263501718640327}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.013667271472513676}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.008939948864281178}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.008513974957168102}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.007691115140914917}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.006151612848043442}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.004457158036530018}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.003711649915203452}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.0034886421635746956}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.003181429347023368}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.002376056741923094}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.0023041791282594204}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.0017741776537150145}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.0010620184475556016}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.0008864853880368173}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.00039383588591590524}]]"

"crush help so i've had this off and on crush on a long distance friend... 

they know about my issues, and they know i've been crushing on them. they have made it VERY CLEAR that they will not tolerate anything negative. i'm so scared of making them dislike me i just withdraw and hide my pain. i know i'm not their responisibility but it still hurts.  

like a week before i was hospitalized, i asked them if i ever do anything that annoys them (BAD DECISION) and they said i send way too many messages while they are at work and they can't focus. of course the air raid sirens started going off in my head and i started burning bridges and self destructing. i apologized to them after my hospitalization (not related to them) and they were really angry and said i should be apologizing to myself. i stayed very distant to them for the past 3 weeks. i assumed they didn't like me anymore.  

anyway... they started talking to me again. they've just had an operation and have been recovering. they've been flirting with me. i just feel complete ecstasy talking with them. i was um ^^pleasuring myself the other day and they said they like when i'm being ""kind"" to myself because i deserve to feel happy... a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a stop please i can't distance myself if i love you . it's long distance. i need someone i can physically be with.. I'M SO TORN. UGH. i getting attached to them again and thinking about it more is giving me anxiety. i want it to get closer. i want it so bad. but it's not an option. how do i stop it without just cutting them out completely?  

i'm currently in a really good mood. i only got 3 hours of sleep but i'm feeling ok. i'm getting stressed out talking to them. why couldn't they stay distant. i worked so hard to make myself alone and miserable.

"Should I file a police report against my bf who raped and physically abused me? I have bpd. I'm going through counseling for it and realized through my healing that my boyfriend abuses me.

He's sent me in the hospital after I tried to hurt myself and when I told him the doctors said I needed to be with someone after I left, he accused me of lying and being manipulative. He then asked for money for me traumatizing him through my self harm. He wanted Over $600 for his services.

I've been with him for about 1/2 a year and there have been multiple times he's had sex with me without my consent.

The most recent time was less than 72 hours ago. I realize that if I file the police report and they need evidence, I need to file it within that time frame.

I'm not sure what the effects of this will be for me. I'm scared that if I don't he will continue to think it's accent behavior. I'm also afraid if I don't I'll just continue accepting him walking over me.

"I always feel abandoned and it's so tiring I'm in somewhat of a long distance relationship and I keep looking for signs of rejection, and any small thing makes me feel devalued, unloved, humiliated and abandoned. It’s like I need constant fucking reassurance and appreciation, and it’s getting so tiring. He has not been talking to me as often as before, and I know it’s mostly because he is going through a bad period, but I can barely focus on anything else. I want to ask him if he loves me or cares about me, and I want to say that sometimes I feel like dying even though I don’t *really*, because I have things I look forward to in the future but the present has been so empty for a long time now. I just want to hear that I matter because I just don’t feel like I do. 

He met a lot of his friends recently and I kept feeling that they were probably much better than me, and that I don’t matter anymore at all once I’m not the only one around. I have a really hard time accepting that being happy with others and not being physically around me doesn't automatically mean that he doesn't care anymore. It’s so incredibly selfish but I really wish I was the only one that could make him truly happy, because that would be something certain and I could stop worrying about whether I’m still enough. 


I hate that I see abandonment in everything. A couple of days ago I said I missed him and he didn’t say he missed me too. I’m in pain for days and if not that, I feel empty and unneeded, and I just think about the future because I made sure I’ll have something to look forward to. But I really don’t want to depend on anyone, because that feels weak and I don’t want to lose control in that sense. I want to be happy about happiness that doesn’t involve me, I don’t want to read things into everything. I don’t want to rely on outside sources for being content. Words of appreciation will make me feel an emotional high, then it’s destroyed the same day by some minor thing which most often is meaningless.

It's kind of like a Jekyll and Hyde situation. Lat time it happened was around 2 weeks ago during a trip with my friends. I got into a tiff with my best friend, and the next thing I remember was her saying she wante to get away from me. Everything I said in those 30 seconds (it was a really short yet impetuous fight) completely vanished off my mind.

I really wish it could stop since that led me to having no friends, and I would like to prevent it next time I feel it coming.","[[{'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.23919713497161865}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.19091375172138214}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.15939170122146606}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.10900016129016876}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.08336876332759857}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.06277546286582947}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.0259880218654871}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.02503521367907524}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.018302476033568382}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.013716732151806355}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.010515031404793262}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.008677265606820583}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.00842644926160574}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.0065663643181324005}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.005786793772131205}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.005068565718829632}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.004207201302051544}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.0039271824061870575}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.003611214691773057}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.0031376476399600506}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.0026407709810882807}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.0022995600011199713}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.002070367569103837}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.0018243471859022975}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.0014150579227134585}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.0009131590486504138}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.0004161775577813387}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.0002978425764013082}]]"
"Dealing with extreme emotions Really tired of this feeling all emotions to the extreme thing. I just did an exam that I thought was going to be TERRIBLE, but it wasn’t (I think). Now, I’m at an equally terrible high. I’m scared that if I didn’t do well in the exam, this is all gonna come crashing down and it’ll suck worse than the good feeling high right now. 

What are some ways you deal with extreme emotions? I am aware that all of this may turn out the way I don’t want it to, but I know emotionally I can never be prepared for when it happens, and either I will feel the pain very very hard, or I will go numb. Based on personal experience, I’ve found it’s usually the latter.

"who else struggles with excessive daydreaming to the point where you can't connect with the outside world? Ive always been a very vivid daydreamer, especially as a kid. Back then i could read a few pages of a book, get inspired and then create an intricate inner world in my mind and run with it from there. I struggled a lot as a kid to fit in from kindergarten to high school, i found it hard to make friends and socialise. There was a good deal of bullying and rejection as well. I've always retreated into my own mind, however now at 22 I find its becoming hard to stay connected to the  rest of the world.
I more often than not feel like theres a glass wall between me and other people. On top of that i have a general ambivalence towards others, i find the conversations in my head fulfilling and real enough that i don't care about making an effort with other people. I find myself often getting lost in my daydreams, I know the difference between fantasy and real life but it feels like i get stuck inside myself. At work I'm friendly and sociable enough with new people and make an effort, however soon find myself not caring and i slowly stop talking to them. If i do socialise with people i feel I'm instantly very janky and awkward, which I'm assuming forces me to retreat further. Often I can barely wait for work or uni to be over so I can be by myself, ill talk to other people if I'm particularly desperate and trying to make time fly by but thats about it. 
I've also dissociated severely in the past but i don't think thats part of this issue. 

I had so many other thoughts I was going to jot down but they're escaping me right now, I guess what i'm trying to find out is if anyone else has had similar experience.","[[{'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.28501462936401367}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.1831991821527481}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.10680321604013443}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.09770951420068741}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.08753713220357895}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.0835001990199089}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.07162870466709137}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.06090506911277771}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.040643803775310516}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.02877919003367424}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.018298471346497536}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.009397920221090317}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.008799531497061253}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.008019986562430859}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.006385446526110172}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.005024915095418692}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.004140756092965603}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.003507880959659815}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.003261430887505412}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.0032450519502162933}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0028347985353320837}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.0024455238599330187}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.0020663125906139612}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.0019163333345204592}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.0015546949580311775}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.001145656919106841}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.0005743480869568884}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.00018011126667261124}]]"
"DAE avoid their bedroom out of anxiety? My anxiety kicks up at night, particularly the later it gets, when bedtime draws near. I have anxiety during the day too, but I'm usually able to overcome it by focusing on something. At night, however, I'm prone to this kind of anxiety that makes me avoid my bedroom... I feel more comfortable/at ease/distracted by being on the couch, and I'll usually mindlessly browse facebook or watch infomercials until I can't keep my eyes open anymore and pass out (note I say ""passing out"" because I can't make the conscious decision to just ""go to sleep""). Some nights the anxiety is so bad that I don't pass out, and am forced to go to work the next morning on literally zero sleep. I don't understand it and neither does my psychologist. I can't take it. I'm so exhausted and worn down. I want to understand it so bad so I can start to work on it and overcome it, but even google isn't yielding any relevant results...

It's becoming easier to snap on people, to be hateful, to cut people out without thinking about it. I blow up a lot, I have the strength to at least do half of it in private. 

I just feel crazier every second of the day. I'm a ticking time bomb, I'm just waiting for someone to do something little. 
I hate everybody because of how much I hate myself and I've been letting that takeover so I'm just a different person every day. 
Sometimes I feel like I'm shaking myself by the shoulders, just when it's really, really bad. When I'm using a weight to try to break my arm. I twitch, talk to myself, I calm down very slowly. 

I'm so mean to everyone and I don't want anyone around me and I can't stay in a room by myself. Every day it's a new hell. I think I'm managing because I'm turning into someone else. A functional, manipulative, aggressive mess.

"I've spent 3 months searching for a therapist and realized there is no help for me. I've been searching for a therapist for 3 months now. I have 3 criteria. In my insurance, does DBT, Specializes in Borderline. 

I put in the filter for my insurance since I don't have $100+/week to spend and instantly I'm knocked down to around 20 people. 

Then I put in DBT and i get literally zero results. I don't even get to put in the borderline filter and I get shut down. 

What the fuck am I supposed to do? My insurance is free as it's paid for by the state which is nice because I don't have a job and can't afford any other insurance but they don't cover seemingly any therapists and I can't change because I can't afford it but I can't afford to go without either. 

How am I supposed to get help or get better if I have shit insurance and no money? I'm just lost, I really don't know what to do.

"Is this abuse. I hate this. My mother and step fathers household was filled with strangeness. They would talk in the open about their sex life, though they acted like they were being sneaky  

My mother would comment on my hair, makeup, perfume, telling me I looked like a hooker. She would also ask me what I thought of the models in magazines or on lingerie ads; all when I was very young.

I soon learned that my stepfather loved dressing up in women’s clothing. They also kept their porn collection easy to find. 

My stepfather would always comment on me and my sisters body and how we were developing.
He would also take digital photos of us at the pool, all in front of my mother. He would also walk through my room while I was showering, as my bathroom was attached to my room. 

My mother was a narcissist. She would steal money from me and always stuck by her husbands. 

My step father soon progressed into sneaking into me and my sisters room while we were sleeping. I woke up once to him taking a photo of me in bed in the middle of the night. I also once heard him under my bed and in my closet. Once we found photos from up my sisters dress on his phone. He would sneak photos of me from up my skirt while driving me to school, pretty obviously but I was scared because I was young. I also saw that he googled “sex with step daughters” on his computer. 

He would keep guns in the house and I was always scared of dying. 

We told our mom but she didn’t believe us. She made up excuses for everything. We broke contact with her after a while but he still has an eleven year old daughter. 

I’m fucked up from this. I have nightmares and feel danger all the time. I have no trust and hate sex. I am on mood stabilizers and am in therapy. Fuck this.

"I spent 2017 digging myself into isolation :( I feel so ashamed of 2017. It was truly the worst year of my life, I was extremely suicidal every single day of it. The only reason I’m still here is because I keep hoping things will get better when I’m the one who fucked up my life.

After graduating high school I just got sadder and sadder, I was free from seeing people who had badly hurt me in class everyday, but I no longer got to see the friends and teachers I loved everyday. Without mandatory classes where we saw each other, everyone got too busy and my friend group only gets together once every couple weeks now. I felt abandoned, tried to keep busy by working on art and trying to get a job, but after a couple applications led to no interviews I guess I just gave up.

I’m 19, still living with my parents, with no drivers license, no job and very little job experience to get one. I’m trying to sign up for community college for this semester but I’m pretty damn sure it’s way too late to get into any classes. I didn’t even plan on living this long, I sure as hell never planned on college. I don’t know how to do anything. When I do rarely see my friends and everyone asks what I’ve been up to, I’m too ashamed to say that I’m alone in my room nearly everyday.

I want to get my license and I finished the online course, but my parents are always too busy to help me practice driving, and I get frustrated when I do practice because we don’t get along, so it gets really stressful and I just end up coming home in tears of sadness or rage. Signing up for classes has been taking so much longer and has so many more steps than I thought it would. I feel so stupid for not doing this earlier and for not being prepared or knowing how to do this. It’s probably pointless and I feel like the college is just gonna laugh at me for trying to get in this semester when it’s about to start! And I feel like I can’t apply for a job again until I know for sure if I’ll be in community college so that I know what hours I can work.

I wanna stop being a failure and get something done, but I feel so overwhelmed by everything that I haven’t done and need to do, I just spend most of my time stress-crying, unfairly lashing out at everyone, and still not doing anything important. I don’t want to be this pathetic child anymore but it feels like there’s no way out. My biggest fear is that 2018 is gonna turn into another 2017 :(","The expanded size of the tensor (585) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.  Target sizes: [1, 585].

"Why do my intrusive relationship thoughts get worse when I go to work So I have bad retroactive/OCD jealousy where I'm so overwhelmed and threatened by my partners past that I can't function and I obsessively ask questions then struggle to believe (been lied to a lot) but when I take a few days off work, no matter what I'm doing, it eases a lot. Even if we are apart for the day. 
Even if Ive had the day off and have to go to work the next day I don't sleep and it intensifies. It's not like I don't trust  what he's doing, I trust he wouldn't cheat or anything. We text through the day.

But I liked it nonetheless. I'm not going to find another job that pays well enough to support me. Granted, it barely did, but it was income. My landlord is already not too keen with me as far as payments,  so if she finds out I'm unemployed,  that won't be good. I'm already behind on everything else Im supposed to pay monthly.

"Desperately seeking relationship advice I need some help, insight, suggestions, advice, anything. I have been with my significant other for 5+ years, and he has been there for me through everything. So many breakdowns, addictions, tears, mood swings, everything. I love him and he is my best friend. We have been together so long. However, the “spark” has faded a bit. I love the companionship we have, but I don’t feel “in love” anymore. But I still love him dearly, if that makes any sense. He is a very, very good person and would be a wonderful life partner. Here’s the dilemma: I recently met someone else and began to have serious feelings for this other person. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to cheat on my significant other (and haven’t) but I feel like emotionally I’ve already cheated. I am scared to break up with him because of our long history together. It would just seem like such a waste of everything we fought for together. I would lose my best friend. But I also don’t want to let this other person go. I feel alive for the first time in a long time. I’m terrified of hurting my significant other, but I am also terrified of possibly making the mistake of not pursuing this potential new relationship. I’ve been struggling with this for a while now, and it is literally tearing me apart. It consumes all of my thoughts. I can barely function. I feel so confused and scared and guilty. I need some help figuring out what to do because I can’t go on like this for much longer. Decisions need to be made soon. I didn’t even want to start the new year with this still looming over my head, but alas. Please help me figure this out.

"Splitting - in need of tips/tricks Hello all -



My splitting is officially at an all time worst. I can have an incredibly satisfying day, but at the wrong time, someone or some thing might send my mind off on its own, and it’s very hard to handle &amp; deal with in stride, without projecting onto anybody.




I’m in the middle of a few legal issues that are keeping me off-Center, so perhaps my BPD/splitting is as wonky as it ever has been because of that, but nonetheless, I would appreciate any and all advice related to keeping the splitting as tame and manageable as possible.

"money, lies, boyfriend, fml I'm going fucking crazy. I feel like dying and I feel like a huge fuck up and an idiot, worthless.

So my boyfriend helped me pay my college tuition (I had to go back to finish up a grad certificate to become a licensed counselor) and I got reimbursement from work. So he paid it and I was just going to pay him back with my reimbursement. I didn't get the full amount, so I was like, well I'll just pay him back with part of my money. I didn't tell him I didn't get the full amount, either. Because I was like, I will figure it out.

It took a while to get the reimbursement, too. I finally did and sent up the transfer, than cancelled it because I needed the money for bills. And I didn't tell him. I just lied and said that I set up the transfer and it should have gone through. I was planning on doing this until my next payday. Then just pay him. And not say anything. Well today he was like, show me your checking account, why hasn't it gone through, etc etc? I ended up telling him the truth. He was rightfully pissed off. Like, I lied. He said he didn't care about the money and he wished I just told him because he would have just let me have the money. He's more upset because I didn't tell him the truth. Again, I get.

I was crying and I apologized and I told him I would pay him back and I acknowledged I lied and how fucked up it was and that he didn't deserve that and that I shouldn't have done it. He said it didn't matter why I did it, but that I did it, and that now he can't trust anything I say or do or have said or done in the past. Related to everything. 

We have had money arguments before. We don't live together, though. He just tells me to tell him when I need help, but I don't want to make my stupid fucking money problems his. So I don't tell him everything going on. I have been able to figure it out mostly. And sometimes I have really bad, desperate months, sadly. But I HATE telling him. Plus he's made comments like, ""how come you have no money?"" I'm a single mom and all my money goes to bills! I have very little spending money. He has two roommates and makes way more money than me. Plus I've been in poverty most of my life, while raising my kid. I make okay/decent money now, but I have a lot of debt. I even brought up having a roommate to him in the past and he is so against it. And I don't know why. But he doesn't want to live with me because I have a kid and because of my rabbits. 

I don't know why I lied. Well ... I am embarrassed as fuck and ashamed about my money situation. I try so fucking hard. And I thought I could pay him without him realizing what actually happened. I realized me lying made it way fucking worse and was fucked up. I feel so bad. 

He left my apartment and walked home. I haven't contacted him. But he said he's not sure what to do about this because he says he cannot trust me at all anymore. I feel like shit. Absolute shit. I want to die. I have been laying in my bed, crying, feel so fucking down. I really fucking love him. It sucks so much. I'm not going to contact him until he contacts me. :( FML.

help! What should I do? I just want to die. Like, dying would be so much easier than dealing with all of this. ","The expanded size of the tensor (789) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.  Target sizes: [1, 789].  Tensor sizes: [1, 514]"
"To tell or not to tell ? So a girl who I've gotten close to exhibits all of the signs of BPD. I know because I've dated a girl with BPD before and I have psychiatrist relatives (I'm not a professional myself but have done a large amount of reading into the subject) 

She's currently cut all contact with me, 2 days after we admitted our feelings for each other. This is not the first time she's gone completely quiet, but it is the longest. 

She's not mentioned to me that she has BPD, but has opened about other issues.

I care for her deeply and want her to be happy. The thought of her sad and alone makes me incredibly sad. 

I think a major part of her improving her life would be to receive some DBT.

But, how should I tell her what I suspect? Can I tell her? 

Part of me is worried she'll double down and never speak to me again, whilst at the same time that's a sacrifice I'm willing to make if the seed gets planted and she seeks help 😥","[[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.791625440120697}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.13025496900081635}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.12827004492282867}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.09244213253259659}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.05604374036192894}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.054469622671604156}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.0390823557972908}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.037566252052783966}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.02724771574139595}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.024914059787988663}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.020442858338356018}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.020276779308915138}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.01801958866417408}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.016773611307144165}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.013740246184170246}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.012965461239218712}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.011646647937595844}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.009411504492163658}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.004578886553645134}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.004452664405107498}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.003970298916101456}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.003358888905495405}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0033477782271802425}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.0023908016737550497}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.0020604960154742002}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.001846563653089106}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.0008663036860525608}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.0007149942102842033}]]"

"Link between BPD symptoms and Problematic Facebook Use: the role of emotion regulation, shame, anger, rejection sensitivity Hi, I am a Clinical Psychologist in Training completing my Doctoral thesis on the above topic. I am a DBT therapist and have worked clinically with many people with BPD. I found that facebook use could sometimes exasperate symptoms of BPD and found it to be a real problem  clinically, but very little research conducted into this important area. I would be so grateful if anyone here who has a diagnosis of BPD or feels they meet the criteria for BPD would consider completing this short online study (approx 15 mins). Thanks so much, Denise.

"Barriers for 2018 resolutions Happy New Year! 

Ive found there are a lot of BPD traits which can interfere with achieving resolutions and goals that I set myself. For example, I want to get my finances in order and lose weight.... that's pretty difficult when I am crazy impulsive and have an unhealthy relationship with food (binge/purge/starve repeat).

BUT I'm still going to persevere and use my DBT to help ensure that I am successful and do so in a healthy and positive way.

I think we play life on hard mode and if we can find the tricks and walk throughs to help us get to the end we can do it and be successful.

"Arguing with people in my head? Beating myself up? (Skills needed) This is not the same thing as preparing for an argument I feel is going to come or if I want to assert myself with someone. Usually in that case I'll just tell myself I'm not a fortune teller, I can't predict how the conversation will go, and that I'm choosing to suffer and cause myself more distress be not being mindful of the current moment, then I'll try deal with the current emotions (usually anger fear or sadness) with acceptance.

No, what happens is like stepping on an emotional landmine I didn't know was buried. If I'm wound up about something else or feeling particularly emotionaly vulnerable, I'll find some way to link the current events to a past trauma, usually from someone I felt has abandoned me or whom I currently have a poor relationship with that I am unhappy about.

From there it's just a deep deep spiral down as my self belittling leads me to have an argument with this person in the past, all the things they said, didn't do, things I didn't say but wish I did. I end up feeling so sad sand angry at that person from all these repressed feelings I never dealt with for over 15 years, on top of the distress and vulnerability that I was already experiencing that I usually just end up in crisis, and have to deal with that (usually default to tipp and self sooth the sadness once I've calmed down). All the fear, anger, sadness, betrayal, abandonment it all just comes swirling back as I do battle with this phantom that will never know the turmoil I am truly going through in trying to cope with our broken/toxic relationship.

What even is this coping mechanism? It only seems to serve to beat me further into a hole i'm already in. It almost like a PTSD flashback but purely for emotions.

"DAE try pleasing all and see themselves as a chameleon? If people find certain things to be annoying, I won't do them at all just to stop them from being annoyed if I do them, so I'm very limited to the things I actually do and is a reason why I'm mainly mute in social situations. I don't act out things I want to do in my head (surprise hugs, saying random things out of the blue, etc). I have gotten a bit better though.

"i want to quit DBT reason :
I am male , but there are only females in the group

its tediously slow!

we meet, make a (silly) relaxing exercise , either mental, or bit physical (like mikado, or throw 2 balls)

talk about homework, which is from that book which is written so poorly OMG

then we have a useless BREAK because several people smoke ... 

then the actual therapy begins... we keep repeating Mindfulness every 2 months or so ... 

so we fucking never progress ... its 2 steps forward and 1 step back

then half an hour before its over 

we play a fucking stupid game again , either mental or bit physical.

its annoyingly slow

takes 2 hours to go over 3 pages in the book

with traveling this keeps my busy for 3 hours ... its half a day ruined.

this seems so inefficient...

regarding the content : 51% is uselfull .... 49 % I cannot relate and dislike their presentation

time allocation 33% uselfull .... 66% not

so 50% of 1/3rd of the time spent I find useful 

I think I just answered my question... I should quit after the next few sessions

"How to tell my therapist that ADHD medication is making me emotionally volatile and slightly paranoid? Prior to ADHD medication, I was unmotivated and depressed. I kind of just focused on my eating disorder and shoplifting and self harm to cope with problems. After being on medication, I stopped most impulsive behaviors like shoplifting and being impulsively rude. 

I wish everything were ok, but I think stimulants make me seriously overreact to when things don't go my way. It sounds really childish, but if I don't get my way, I'll become angry and resentful and also cry uncontrollably and my mind will wander to ways I can self harm to get back at them because I know there's nothing I can actually do to harm them. But then after 1 hour of being not in control of my emotions, I'll get distracted by something, and then all is well, and I'm wonder why I was so upset to begin with? And I'll feel regretful because I was mean to my mom or to my friends. 

And the things I say, I know, are dramatic, but in the moment, I believe it. And after the moment, I'm just thinking, wtf? I also know I'm more paranoid than usual in that when things go wrong, there's always someone to blame. In my mind, someone doesn't like me and is making things up about me to cause problems, and that's why I have these problems. Lol you know, because it's never my fault. I'll logically know that it is my fault and that these people aren't looking to cause problems for me,  but I won't believe it. 

I'm off topic. The thing is that the quality of life has really improved since being on ADHD medication, except for being really not in control of my emotions when things don't go my way or people tell me what to do. But then, I don't want to be off this medication either because this is still a lot better than how things use to be.

"Am I ready for recovery? So in the first week of 2016, I was warded for the first time. I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and borderline personality disorder. After 5 admissions each to the child and adult ward, drugs/addiction/withdrawal, sitting on high window ledges, suicide pacts and a lot of cutting, I’m finally the closest I’ve ever been to actual recovery. I haven’t cut in a long time, I’m back in school and coping rather well, and I’ve managed to stay out of the ward for more than just a couple months.

Given, I’m not exactly super happy or enthusiastic about life, and I do have a a lot of downs and anxieties, but I’m coping better. I’m not breaking down. Suicide still crosses my mind from time to time, but I don’t act on it. I know that sooner or later, I will be taken off my meds. I would be completely discharged from the hospital. But I’m so scared. I can’t remember what life was like without mental illness. I’m terrified of the idea of life without professional psychiatric help. My meds help me sleep. And I can sleep through anything. But without them, I’m terrified of being alone with my thoughts and staying awake all night. I’m terrified of being truly alone.

I want a healthy happy life. I want my parents to stop worrying about the side effects of my meds. I want my Mom to stop being ashamed/burdened that I have appointments at the hospital. But I’m so scared. Really really scared.

"What do you guys think of this? ""I Will"" by Orlando Rogers I Will:

1. Have a plan, know where I’m going and how I’m going to get there. I will have waypoints, goals and targets along the way.

2. Act today as tomorrow never comes. I will be ruthless in my quest to complete even the most menial of tasks.

3. Be positive. I will not entertain negative thoughts or people. My positive attitude will be contagious, whereas negative attitude is cancerous.

4. Spend so much time bettering myself that I do not have time, nor the will to find fault with others.

5. Learn as much as I can from everyone I meet and everything I do. My brain capacity is endless so I will bless it with endless amounts of knowledge and information.

6. Have an unrelenting pursuit for excellence in everything I do. I will not wallow in mediocrity.

7. Utilise all my spare time constructively, not fooling myself by completing the tasks that are simple over those that are important.

8. Carry a note pad! My brain is my supercomputer and my notepad is my screen. Writing something down gives you a 90% chance of completing it.

9. Expose myself to hardships in order to appreciate the simple pleasures of everyday life.

10. Always take the hard route, and take the choice that I am afraid of taking, for it will make me stronger.

11. Predict the future accurately…by inventing it.

12. Be enthusiastic and constantly aspiring. The world will step aside for me as I know where I am going.

13. Be successful. I am the master of my own destiny, the captain of my soul. I know where I want to go and my future is in my hands, and my hands only.

14. Make time to help others who are on a quest for knowledge. I am that man who asks for advice, and thus I shall also give it if I can.

15. Expose myself regularly to danger, and avoid rules and regulations. If I adhere to rules and wrap myself in cotton wool, I will be a pathetic mess when the rules and regulations are not there to protect me. I have been blessed with the ability to make contemplated decisions – which I will live with making. I have judgement, which I will use in anger.","The expanded size of the tensor (517) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.  Target sizes: [1, 517].  Tensor sizes: [1, 514]"

"Feeling like people at work hate me First time ever posting anything. So I'm really not used to talking or posting at all. I've been having reoccurring issues at work and was wondering of other people felt the same, also needed to talk about it somewhere.

So I work at a place that handles mail and I'm typically working in one specific zone in my department. But every now and then I'll be asked to go out and deliver some of the mail to various offices in the area. Easy enough job: read the addresses on the letters, drop off the letters at the correct office. There's usually one route I go on and at this point I have it memorized and could probably walk it blindfolded. However the second I walk into one of the office buildings I lose composure.

I'm not sure if this is just anxiety or part of BPD but delivering mail absolutely scares me. I believe I'll mess up somewhere, deliver the wrong mail to the wrong place, forget to grab something, miss an office, or just do something wrong. I'll walk in, sometimes small talk, but feel like the people in the office just hate me. Like soon after they're gonna call my boss and complain that I've messed up everything. And every time I walk out of an office I always have to stop for a few seconds. I get this feeling like they're going to walk out with mail in hand angrily telling me that I've messed up or done something wrong. It'll get so bad that most times I completely blank out and lose focus. I feel like I'm in some weird alternate universe or I'm not there, like I just don't exist with everyone or I exist somewhere else. 

I've been having this feeling for months and months and I've tried talking to a counselor about it before and didn't really get much help or response. I just wanted to know if anyone else feels this sort of thing, ","[[{'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.3996601700782776}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.2738739252090454}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.2606128752231598}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.15781886875629425}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.08658250421285629}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.07097145169973373}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.07044098526239395}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.05529946833848953}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.03864965960383415}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.03379243239760399}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.019183555617928505}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.016407987102866173}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.013055612333118916}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.011808122508227825}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.010992146097123623}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.009502461180090904}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.009042792022228241}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.005962783936411142}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.005390109959989786}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.004443331155925989}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.0040199533104896545}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.003954250365495682}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.0032002634834498167}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.0025809998624026775}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.0023107940796762705}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.00208316114731133}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.0007525488617829978}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.000602261396124959}]]"

One of the craziest things I do is split black when someone expresses they have discovered my favorite food or something from being near me. They reveal little things about my habits and likes and then BOOM I split black and go no contact because they got too close.

"Been in DBT for a couple of months now and it's helped I've spent every day of my life feeling like I was the most broken person I'd ever meet and things changed a lot when I saw that same look on the faces of 5 other people in group therapy. Things changed a lot when I learned to start tracking and questioning my thoughts so I could put a stop to the rote self-destruction that was taking place inside my mind every moment of every day. Things changed a lot when I started practicing radical acceptance, by learning to stop judging other people I've gradually made it easier to stop judging myself. Things changed a lot when I learned that my abusers aren't monsters, they're just struggling broken people like I am, and that doesn't mean I have to forgive them. Things changed a lot when I learned the difference between accountability and blame.

I'm not better but I'm getting better. I'm not happy, I'm at peace. I want everyone struggling with this to know that there is hope. ""It gets better"" isn't just a thing people say, it's something that can happen when we learn how to make it happen.","[[{'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.3433154821395874}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.3046491742134094}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.15177343785762787}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.0728953629732132}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.060412004590034485}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.05208783224225044}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.04188690707087517}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.03836709260940552}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.02858532778918743}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.02156914584338665}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.018578194081783295}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.017283784225583076}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.012604743242263794}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.009996133856475353}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.008446305990219116}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.006821770686656237}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.00548395374789834}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.004416308365762234}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.004028927069157362}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.003238172736018896}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.0028223819099366665}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.0025211339816451073}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.0024959298316389322}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.002109742956236005}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0017186839831992984}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.00160207599401474}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.0014440460363402963}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.0006705616833642125}]]"
"I feel completely numb and zoned out For the last few days this has been going on, I fell out with my dad, he is narcissistic and everything is about him. Normally we would be yelling at each other or I'd end up doing something stupid.

"Anyone Ever Take STD for BPD Hello. 
Newly diagnosed here and amongst trying to handle this condition amongst other stresses, I’m thinking about applying for STD from Work. Has anyone else done this? I was committed about three weeks ago, released, seeing a therapist and have an appointment with a psychiatrist in about a week. This condition is so hard to deal with on a daily basis, that it’s starting to interfere with my activities of daily living. I don’t want to go back to the hospital, but I’m feeling like I did before I was admitted and don’t want to have a relapse. Anybody else take short term disability?

"Drugs and BPD I'm struggling to even see a point in trying to be sober. I've been drinking and smoking weed since I was 15. I'm super into psychedelics, I don't know how to see drugs as negative rather than positive. Drinking I could quit, it'd be hard but I could. Although when it comes to drugs (marijuana, ketamine, lsd) I don't think I'll ever be able to not do them. I have a hippie mindset when it comes to psychedelics, although I'm starting to believe that sobriety could possibly help with symptoms. I just do not see a point in even trying to quit doing drugs because I love them so much. 

LSD completely re-wires my brain when I do it. I feel brand new, I feel like everything is going to be alright. I see everything from the most wild and creative perspective. There is no other feeling like watching phish play 3 sets on some good acid. I don't know. I smoke marijuana almost every night, it helps me to reflect on my day and see things from a much more calm and realistic perspective. Ketamine I only do rarely because it's hard to find where I am, but when I do it it's so damn psychedelic and amazing. It also helps with my depression.

So what I'm saying is, why should I even try to be sober? I only have one life, this is it. Why not indulge in the psychedelics? Marijuana is the only drug I do often, and it doesn't affect my life poorly. I have a good job and I'm doing okay, so I do not see the point in not having fun every now and then. 

The only reason I am questioning my substance use is because I have recently started DBT and I've been told to cool it. But I truly do not believe I need to. I'm not addicted, so what is the issue?

"Anyone feel like your trust issues have already doomed a relationship? Found out for probably the fifth time that my boyfriend who I live with had been chatting up random girls ""for fun"". Had a good Convo and he finally opened up to me about things in the first time in forever. I do self destructive things all the time and it sounded familiar so I let it slide somewhat. I said if there's a next time I'm gone for good, which I actually mean, and I'm very proud of myself for coming to a point where I'm not so dependant on people. (Yay meds) 

But I feel this heavy weight now, constantly. He's my best friend but now he doesn't even feel like it. Like I don't know him anymore. I don't get excited by him anymore. I don't get happy when he does something nice. Because I feel as if all of it is fake. All of it means nothing and every action is for a selfish gain. I don't trust absolutely anything he does. But instead of going insane because of it, as I usually would, I find myself just numbing myself to him if that makes sense. I think I'm finally realizing that he can't give me what I want, and that is a trustful partner who I feel secure with. And if that's it, then good. I'm glad I'm realizing it.

It's just a strange feeling to not run after him for being what I think is ""distant"" anymore. It's strange to think ""well that's just how he is"" without being so incredibly pained and feeling like I can change him. I've stopped with all the typical borderline personality things, I'm not begging or chasing anymore. 

Which is good. It's great. Cause I've worked so hard to get here. I.. just don't know how to deal with it? 

I don't know if this makes any sense at all. Basically I'm just saying my route to healing is very confusing to me because it's so new to not feel certain feelings anymore. Or to feel the same fears I've had before (trust issues) in a different way. It feels unnatural. 

Like my brain is saying but wait.. you're SUPPOSED to depend on people. What are you doing just sitting there and not begging for him to change? What are you doing not caring enough to constantly be looking over his shoulder? Etc etc.

"Jealousy Does anyone else experience jealousy with a best friend?
I've known my best friend for 9 years. She's someone I can confide in and I trust more than anyone besides my spouse.
She has another friend, someone I am becoming friends with myself, but I've always felt some jealousy when I hear they're hanging out or they tag each other on Facebook posts. It makes me irrationally jealous and I constantly tell myself that she has other friends, it's no big deal but I always feel like it's a competition, particularly with this specific friend, to be liked more by my best friend.
It drives me crazy because I don't think I should be feeling this way but I can't help but feel that twinge of jealousy every time.

It feels better to know what is actually going on with me after reading so much, before my diagnosis I was just blaming everything on the way I was eating, wasn’t exercising enough, my life is going in this direction because of reasons X, Y, Z and I’m just tortured emotionally because I deserve it and/or I did something wrong in the past or in a past life. I don’t know. This post is the first time I’m putting something out there about the hole that I have been in the past couple of days. I just hurt and feel the need to decay and feel like everyone would just be better off without me.

"Help dealing with someone who might suffer from BPD So, I was dumped by my GF about a month ago. here's the thing, we got together around mid September, and things were great. She herself told me things were great and we were really happy together. Then the weekend after Thanksgiving she told me she she felt like something was missing from how she felt about me and that she just wanted me as a friend. 

Now, the thing is that she said something about having BPD and I never really understood what that was exactly, and after doing some research it seems that it could be the reason she suddenly turned cold and distant from me after we had been so close. 

I love this woman to death and have been a wreck since the split. I would really do anything for her, and I don't want to make the wrong move here. What should I do? Give her space? Assure her how much I care and that I'll still be here for her?

"The ""distorted self-image"" symptom [warning: text wall] In the list of BPD symptoms, I came across ""distorted self-image or unstable sense of self"" for the first time. That was a new one for me, and since my diagnosis, it's always stuck out like a sore thumb. SO much of my life has started to make sense since my diagnosis. It's helpful and confusing at the same time. The past I can make sense of, but my future makes me question everything. 

For myself, the disorder manifests as obsessive jealousy and self-comparisons. That further turns into me completely absorbing the hobbies and traits that make up someone else's form of self-expression and lifestyle. It's always another girl for me. Usually the ex-girlfriend of someone I'm currently dating. I completely zone in on everything about them in order to emulate it: their hair, their make-up, contacts or glasses, where they buy their clothes, what they go to school for, their extracurriculars and hobbies. It started with my third relationship, when I was (floundering) in college before my second sloppy medical leave. I was insanely jealous of one of my then SO's ex's. She was, in my eyes, much prettier than me. More socially successful. And, in anyone's eyes, MUCH more well-adjusted post-high school. 

In high school, I stopped wearing gender-neutral clothing and had to shop at Delia's and American Eagle. I had to be in the best auditioned choral groups. I had to be chosen for every school play. I had to be at every theatre extracurricular. 

In college, I had to be amazing at cosplay and be completely immersed in the local cosplay community in my city. I started buying quirky off-brand clothing. I started wearing circle lenses. Watched anime after I honestly stopped caring about it. Watched shows I knew this girl liked. 

I thought those were moments when I was doing well, like I was at a high point in the roller-coaster of life. I never really confronted the fact that while I felt motivated and driven for a time, those feelings sprang out of raging envy.

It comes and goes with different girls. I'm so glad I finally pinpointed what it was that drove my brain to act in this disorderly way. But I realize now, at nearly 26, I never invested in... me. Who am I now? What do I really like? How do I express myself? What hobbies actually matter to me? One thing I'm successful in, I'm finally not tanning anymore and I'm letting my natural brown hair grow back in. But moving forward, and in a new relationship, I'm scared to try things that my boyfriend likes. Concerts or sports and such. What if I'm trying new things but it's for the wrong reasons? I feel like I'm constantly questioning my sanity. I reapplied to a community college. It took some time to convince myself I was doing Psychology for the right reasons. 

What do others in this sub think of that symptom? This is sometimes tied to the ""chameleon effect"" that almost everyone engages in, but with BPD it seems to consume your life and you loose complete sight of who you are. Thanks for reading this essay, I'd love to hear similar or even tangential stories. ","The expanded size of the tensor (717) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.

"I think my boss is keeping me around as a charity case To give a bit of background, I work as a receptionist in a small office of about 10-15 people. I had a huge falling out with a coworker a few months ago and things have not gone back to normal since. The falling out wasn't entirely my fault either. 
So on to the topic of this post. My boss. 
When I had that falling out, it landed me in her office with her asking me straight up if I suffer from and personality disorders. I decided to tell her the truth about my BPD in confidence and I don't regret that. She's extremely understanding and very nice.
The reason I believe she is keeping me as a charity case is because of the fact that her step-daughter has the same disorder. She see's her daughter in me and wants me to be able to have the opportunity to grow and be able to better myself. Instead of jumping from job to job. 
I realize writing this, she seems like an amazing boss. And she is. But she said something to another coworker of mine, who also happens to be my best friend, during her performance review that has me extremely pissed off and feeling betrayed. 
During my friends performance review, my boss told her that ""{I'm} is only still working here because I like her and I want to give her a chance""
Does that mean that everything else that I do for the office is overlooked? My work doesn't matter? Is my work even good?
During my performance review, I got basically negative criticisms and very shallow compliments. 
My mood needs to change, I need to stop taking things personally, I need to start being a team player, etc...
And for the good things, well, I dress nicely and I'm always on time and I'm good with customers. 
Know that while my mood does need improvement, I'll be the first to admit it, I know that I don't take things personally and that I'm a good team player. The only person I don't get along with is that one employee and no one gets along with her because she's such a bitch. I know I don't take things personally because I know that everything said is work related. I just get frustrated when I'm basically harassed for the same things over and over again for 15-20 minutes straight. That's not taking it personally. That's getting pissed off at an annoying coworker.

Anyway, I digress, I want to know if the way I feel toward my boss is alright. I'm mostly mad that she said what she said to my coworker / friend. So can anyone give me their insight?

"Thriving as a Borderline. Hey all.
 Quick background info:I’m 17 and male. My mother has BPD to an extremely high degree. My father isn’t always present. I do not know if I am full on BPD or just pick up on symptoms from my mother. My emotions are definitely unstable and I mostly feel depressed.  Many symptoms are present but there are times where I seem to escape the entire disorder.
My question is, how do I survive or better yet thrive with BPD? 
It has many setbacks but I’ve noticed it has its perks and many upsides. The intense emotions allow for a vibrant personality. I can connect with people one-on-one very easily and for some reason I’m very captivating. I’m an introvert but when I start talking with people, they seem to be like magnets to me. I attribute this to the BPD, as I always skip small talk and dive into philosophy and the meaning of life, chasing the rush we all do. People seem to like this personality, and it fuels my ego so I stick with it. 
The biggest issue I face with BPD is when I’m alone (romantic relationship wise) I’m very depressed and my brain spirals into excessive thought, then into depression. It seems to me that when I was in a relationship, most of my symptoms subsided. I’m guessing this is because I accessed the flow of love that BPD’s crave. I’m now weary of relationships and love-avoidant. It’s very odd, as when I consider getting into another relationship, I immediately think of how much I’ll hurt the other person if I choose to leave. It’s an extreme form of empathy and rather irrational. I close myself off and don’t allow myself to talk with any females In fear of them having expectations.
Do you guys suggest I just start talking with people and attempt to be in a relationship if it seemed to help with the symptoms before? Or do I need to sort myself out before hand? Any other advice on how to thrive as a Borderline is appreciated.

Edit: I did not really describe my symptoms very well, so I will list them here and maybe gain insight about what they could represent.
I have a void in my stomach often. I try and fill it with drugs, drama, fantasizing, etc. it’s different than depression, and whoever coined the term “void” was spot on.
I also experience the entire spectrum of emotions daily. Super excited and motivated, to suicidal within only a few hours apart. I then hit a dissociated feeling when they get too much.
I have a weird drive to attain love, but when I actually am about to, i get anxiety and quickly find fault in the situation. Lastly, I always feel like I am acting. Putting on masks for people based on their own personality. I think of it as mirroring. But I am also acting even when alone, as I don’t feel like I am anything? If that makes sense. Again I am not sure if this is BPD, Bipolar or something else but it has led me to believe BPD.","The expanded size of the tensor (687) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.

"I think I might actually have ASPD, but who knows. okay so I’ve never actually made a post here so hey, 

I was diagnosed with BPD at 16. (yes I know you’re normally meant to be 18 but mine was seen as a special case as I had symptoms/difficulty for a long time) 
I didn’t know much about it at the time, but displayed quite a lot of symptoms, e.g extreme mood swings, emptiness, self harm. But over the past couple of years I seem to have stopped experiencing the core ‘BPD’ symptoms, only really feeling ones such as emptiness, anger bursts and self harm that are seen in a lot of disorders. I’ve also been learning a lot about myself and realised I struggle with empathy, do a lot of things out of impulse and have been told I’m highly irresponsible. Basically, near enough all the symptoms of ASPD. However I honestly don’t want to get diagnosed due to the huge stigma attached to ASPD- it’s essentially psychopathy. Plus, I’m not a doctor so I’m not 100% this is right anyway. 
Do I go back to the psychiatrist, or do I simply carry on living with the BPD label? Also is anyone here comorbid with any disorders, as I also want to see if this is a possibility?

"I seem to have gotten worse, despite therapy, DBT and getting older I'm 29 now. I've done a lot of therapy, and did a whole DBT course.

When I'm upset about something, I tend to think, ""Meh, fuck this"" if I'm implored by a DBT hand-out to do something to distract myself or practice mindfulness. Worse - I do it, see I'm still being ignored after a reasonable amount of time passes, and then I'm more angry at myself - at least when I assumed the worst, I didn't have the additional feelings of foolishness and humiliation from having the audacity of hope and being newly disappointed.

On the contrary, with CBT for OCD, I actually want to do it, and it helps tremendously.

The other thing is I feel I'm too far gone in my crazy person ways to change. Probably how criminals feel - that you'll never be part of normal society again, so why not commit more crimes, because you're screwed anyway.  I've got a whole fleet of guys who think I'm a crazy stalker, and last year I got a restraining order from one - my first brush with the law; my first objective ""she's crazy"" branding. 

I'm 29 now. Nothing's really improved since I was 19.  From what I've read, BPD symptoms are meant to get better over time. 

Any ideas on how to develop a more positive mindset?

"i feel lost today That imaginary abandonment is creeping back in.


My current partner was texting other girls for a while to ""keep his options open"" at the start of our relationship. It had stopped before i found out and i did follow up on it and it doesnt appear to have started up again, but i think about it constantly...


I love him and other than that one thing hes perfect. Hes funny, understanding and does so much for me. [hes basically my house wife while i go to work]


But hes somewhat distant with me for a day, and not even all that distant and im straight away assuming hes going to leave, hes found someone else, he doesnt love me anymore...


its so painful staying in a long term relationship when youre own insecurities make you mentally separate over and over... 

the upside is i get to fall back in love with them over and over but still.


Ive felt so lost lately. I feel like my life has no meaning and the only thing of value now is this relationship. I cut ties with my family because of the abuse but that leaves me with no one if this goes down the shitter. Which is why i stayed with the abuse for so long... 


all this hanging over my head is tiggering the suicidal ideation again. I just dont want to deal with it anymore. I dont want to die but when no one will listen to me what other option do i have.


I used to believe i was bi-polar because i woud experience high moods that were so incredible. I felt so alive and free and powerful. but its been maybe 8 months since ive felt anything but empty or depressed. 


All the weight i lost trying to get myself on track and show myself some love. Ive put back on binge eating trying to give myself just something to actually enjoy.


Id self harm if it werent for my partner. I dont think he'd appreciate me slicing at myself. 


Work also put a fucking investigation against me because i was smashing my targets and thats apparently suspicious when no one else was [bear in mind its a call center that ive been at 2.5 years and everyone else had been there less than 6 months and some had only started this week] jokes on them, 100% compliance.


I simply just exist. I am not a character in my own life. Im just sorta here.","[[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.6803341507911682}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.31632503867149353}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.18927419185638428}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.047499921172857285}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.03150156885385513}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.02898186445236206}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.026644831523299217}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.018587566912174225}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.01809709519147873}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.015000438317656517}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.011289596557617188}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.011033257469534874}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.0098760686814785}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.007990949787199497}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.007865126244723797}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.007838014513254166}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.007316337898373604}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.004775906912982464}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.004653413314372301}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.0045683314092457294}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.0045291646383702755}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.002778528491035104}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.002611712086945772}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.002443684497848153}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0019153995672240853}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.0018065330805256963}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.0008803289965726435}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.0006108312518335879}]]"

"It’s easy to forget I have BPD. I generally stay away from this subreddit because there is generally sooo much negativity, and I try to distance myself from things like that as best I can. Sorry :(

Anyway, I do check in occasionally. Y’all have me cracking up tonight because I relate SO MUCH to everything said. It’s just kinda hilarious that this stupid disorder is so accurate in its character. 

My personal case is not super extreme, admittedly. So generally I go through life just thinking that my actions/thoughts/emotions are me. But then I read stories from people with BPD and re-remember, “shit, like my entire life is explained by this lol.”

"Thank you all who actively voice your problems, and try to help others on this sub. I've known about this place, but because of a misdiagnosis, and me actively trying to lie to myself about who I really am I hadn't visited until 2 days ago. After braking up with my ex 3 days in after getting her back for the 20th time, and making myself look like a liar by going back on my word on how much I changed (I genuinely thought I could handle it and have learned a lot) I've accepted I'm not ""normal"" and need help. I don't want to do this anymore I don't want to continue ruining my own life, and the life of people who care about me (or so they say lol). I did it over jealousy, and suspicions that I am 80% sure are not valid. When she came to get her stuff she found me self harming (most likely was worried I was suicidal) with a switch blade in my hand. Yikes. Of course I regret it, and want her more than anything, but It scared her. After 3 years she can't keep doing this with me while she's going through a lot herself. I want to change mostly for her which might be bad, but also for myself for the first time. I hope regardless of why I do it i'll come out a better person . Anyway sorry for venting, and sorry if this post seems pointless.

"Alyssa from 'The End of The F***ing World' Shows BPD Traits? [Watch on Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/watch/80175729)

**The End of the F✷✷✷ing World** presents a couple of teenagers, James (self-presenting as a psychopath) and Alyssa. James wants to kill her new companion, whilst Alyssa wants to leave their neighbourhood. 

[Episode spoilers (Hover over for spoiler)](/s ""Later, the two become partners in crime eventually killing a sexual predator."")

It is my observation that Alyssa shows some emerging Emotionally Unstable Personality (BPD) traits. She has risky impulsive behaviour, past possible neglect, fractured self-image and emotional regulation as well as problems with interpersonal relationships.

"probems deaing with my FP when im sober I dont reallly know what to do and if this is bpd anxiety or what.

my wife was out tonght drinking and doing coke with a friend who... is not the best influence. i got uneasy about it and asked her to go back to the flat since she isnt a habitual drug user and has been caught off guard a few times.

theres the problem that she doesnt reaize me not testing men not to roofie and rape her (that may have happened once since we got together, she doesnt exacty remember).

on top of this im recenty sober and a week out of a relape. a ´so called friend who once gave me a to of clonopin and cava then had sex with me that i dont remember a few years back. i dont do clonopin. i had a 24 hour backout. somehow the other day i decided to go help  this friend cook dinner, i remember her getting pushy, i was out of painmeds, she gave me clonopin, and the only things i remember for the next 24 hours was her being annoyed at me and trying to leave but i was too incapacitated.

so im not in a good state, even for me.

at 2am i asked her to go home, because the bar she was at is famous for rapists and she was pretty much alone. by three i was saying i need her to go home, by five i was flipping out and sending pages long messages because she was telling me her being out drinking doesnt affect me.

well.... it did. and when i say to her it opens old wounds from my first marriage, she used to get drunk and come home with other mens cum on and in her, while i worked two bar jobs full time sober. i trust my wife, but behaviours like these aggravate healing wounds 

she thinks i just think shes gonna cheat on me.

i gotta stay sober, i gotta keep working on me. 

was i out of line

"Broke up with my boyfriend My boyfriend or now ex of 3 years is borderline. I read a lot about borderline to help him and support him the best I could. We even went to his therapist together for a few sessions to make sure I understood and could help him go through all the emotions as a couple. Or try to understand what he was going through. 

He's someone who needs the love of many women. Like all the love I have for him is never gonna be enough to fill his glass. So we opened our relationship a year ago when I moved out of town to study. Our relationship turned into a long distance one. Seeing each other every 2 weeks. Arranging for phone calls and skype dates. 

We placed some ground rules and he followed them. 
But as time passed, his glass never felt full enough. He craved the love of more and more women. 
To the point where he would go out almost every night. Drink and meet girls on tinder. Only for sex. 

Tonight, I told him I had enough and I wanted to do a Skype date with him. 
He begged me to wait. He wanted to go and have sex with a new girl he met on Instagram. He explained to me that he was lonely and needed to be touched. He was feeling suicidal. And being touched was the only thing he needed. 

I told him to go. He left me no choice but to say yes. He used all the arguments in his book. Like a child, he didn't wanna hear the word no I said yes. Even if it hurt me to do so. 

I texted him while he was out and I told him it was over. I explained that while I'm loving and caring and his promise ring meant everything to me, I told him that his constant need to be loved was too much for me and he needed to work on his issues before we could get married. 

He stayed at the bar talking to that girl and he replied to my texts. But I just feel like his borderline and his fear of being alone is why he's acting the way he does. Am I right? 

What am I missing about his and the connection with borderline?

"I have no meds, no doctor, and no options left. Guess I'll die. I've been looking for a new psychiatrist since August. I spent 4 paniced months pouring over my insurance company's website and I finally found one that was willing to see me. I had no other options and was on the last refill my old psych gave me so I made the appointment despite the fact that the office was 3 hours away in a major city notorious for traffic issues and wrecks.

Problem is, I have severe anxiety, and driving is one of my big fears. I'm prone to having panic attacks in heavy traffic or if I get lost. I only recently got comfortable enough to take the interstate to the next town over, and to get to the office I'd have to take the interstate almost the whole way and cross six lanes of traffic to get to the exit. I knew there was no way I could just drive there myself, so I asked someone else to drive me to the intake appointment. I thought knowing where I was going would make it easier for me to drive myself next time.

WRONG. It was my worst fucking nightmare. We were almost hit 4 times.

Fast forward to today, my appointment is on Monday and I've been living in fear of the drive since last November. Then, someone reminds me theres a huge event going on in the city I need to drive to and the traffic is going to be insane. Also it's going to rain and its looking increasingly like the rain is going to turn to ice.

I can't drive in those conditions, there's no way. Best case scenario I wind up stranded on the side of the road begging for someone to come get me. Worst case I fucking kill somebody. I'm not risking it, so I called the office to reschedule the appointment. I figured it would be a few weeks out at most, and they could call me in at least my Wellbutrin and Lithium so I didn't spiral into suicidal depression in the interim. Like my old psychiatrist.

WRONG AGAIN. No appointments available until February 22nd, and no they're not going to call in anything for me. Sucks to suck.

I only made an appointment with them because I was desperate to avoid medication withdrawals. An appointment more than two months after I run out of meds doesn't help me at all, so I told them to take me off their rosters. Now I'm right back to fucking square one, except now I'm completely out of medication, have no one else to call, and don't even have a PCP to ask for help. The only psychiatrists left in a 50 mile radius are self pay. I can't pay $150+ for a 15 minute med check on top of the $80+ for the meds themselves and $200 a month for my insurance, so I guess in the spirit of good ole American healthcare I get to drop dead. It's the only option I can afford.","The expanded size of the tensor (619) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.  Target sizes: [1, 619].  Tensor sizes: [1, 514]"
"Ways to make ammends with your fp after you lashed out at her for the first time Psa : you don't need to tell me what I did was bad, I already know and feel regret, disgust and shame towards myself. Oh yeah, and [tw: emotional abuse, self-harm]
It's now nighttime where I am. Yesterday, at night, around 2 or 3 am I was really spiraling with paranoia, depressive and suicidal thoughts and I was really in need of some support, it was like that first time you do drugs when you're out of rehab. So I reached my fp. But she's currently doing an exchange program (we're not in uni). We're in a 3h timezone difference.so she was asleep. But I really needed some help so I kept asking her for it and I started to get so sk angry she wasn't there and told her that. I won't dive into the monologue I had, but I sent her pictures of my last self harm episode, which was the day before and lied to he telling I did it thinking about her. Then I started hyperventilating and went full on panic attack and told her it was her fault i was even having it. Then those feelings of abandonment I think we all know here really made me paranoic, to the point of telling her she should leave me so i can stop being a nuisance for her an even threatened to do it for her by offing myself.
Anyways, I know how I was really toxic and abusive so what do you think I should do to make things better? We haven't had the chance to talk about cause when the opportunity arrived I had another panic attack, so she then called me and helped me get out of it for about 2 hours. But we haven't properly had the talk and we would later today but she said she's not ready to so besides apologising over and over again, which I am already doing, how can I help her get better so she can really forgive it and we can keep our relationship?

"Getting off seroquel I've been on meds for about 10-11 years and about 4-5 of those I've been on 100mgs of seroquel. 

I don't want to get into every sobby detail of my life but I will say that I've come A LONG WAY. I once thought I'd be dead by 30 (I'm 35) I recently graduated from college with honors and moved to a new city which I really love. After being estranged from my mother for 8 years (who was the reason for my bpd but I don't want to get into that ) we have been slowly mending things and she even purchased a new wardrobe for me so that I have new clothes for my new job which I really love (finally closing the door to working in retail for good 😩🙂) 

Anyways with all of these good things after lots of thought  I have decided that I have gotten the benefits of being on medication and I'm ready to get off them. My dr lowered my 100mg dose  to 50mg last Thursday. On Sunday I was sick with a cold and had a fever so I did the reg stuff one is supposed to get better. Today I noticed that while I'm no longer coughing, my BODY still feels sickly. I'm hardly eating and I just feel a bit out of it and a lil nauseous. I also am getting slight chills 

Could these be symptoms or withdrawal? I see my dr on the 25th so she can lower my dose to 25mg (after a month of being on 50mg) 

Are there things I can do to help the withdrawal symptoms? I just started my new job and I do not want to fuck that up. Today I left early because I was not feeling well but I'm in the clear because my boss remembered how much I was coughing the other day.

"Has anyone else ever had a crisis from thinking their FP/boyfriend was mad or ignoring them? It happened with my boyfriend, turned out he was just in a low mood and busy with friends and couldn't reply much. My mind spiraled and I analyzed everything bad about our relationship and totally broke down. I called my Dad as a last resort when I was on an overpass and he had to walk me home through the phone. I even considered that if the relationship ended, I'd just get a sugar daddy cause then I'd have validation AND money. Then my boyfriend got home and everything is going better than it has the last while and I feel so full of shame. I was CONVINCED he was going to break up with me and he hated me.

"Will my friend ever forgive me? My friend stopped talking to me because she was struggling with an addiction. It messed me up that she didn't wanna talk to me so me being a stupid ass would get into episodes where I'm super emotional and just keep sending her messages on all the platforms we were friends on. I knew she wanted to be alone because she told me so from the start but I don't know. I was very selfish and I still am. She put up with me for 2 months until finally she had enough of me yesterday and blocked me off from everywhere. I'm kinda happy for her sake that she won't have to put up with me anymore but at the same time I'm very sad that I have no contact with her anymore... She was the greatest friend I ever had.

"Is this what splitting is? So all my life I've been part of differemt friend groups. I just usually leave the group for reasons such as ""Oh they're just sick of me now. No one wants to be with me anymore.""  Even though according to them everything was 'fine.'
Recently I was really good friends with a lot of people this time. All of a sudden, idkw, I just started hating all of them. 
Now I don't want to see them all, especially my gf who isn't physically here where I live for now.

"Why things never work out for me Why things never work out for me? It’s like everything in my life works out, I finally found stability and peace with myself, everything works well, except in the relationships field. It starts to feel like it’s me, something about me. I don’t know what it is that I do wrong, that everything I do goes wrong. Met this amazing guy and he was so into me and in less than two weeks he’s not so much anymore. It’s like, every time I start to like someone then it stops. As almost as if, like a game, people only like the chase. When I start liking someone I become super sweet, maybe I’m too much over the place, maybe once I’m taken for granted then the person sees they don’t want to be with me anymore. The people I liked it never worked out, always felt like they didn’t really want to be with me. Those I didn’t love, they chased me and I completely crushed them down. I just want for once for be able to fall in love without the fear of what I do might be wrong or not. I wonder how it feels when you meet someone with whom it does work then? I don’t want to play games, or worry if what I do is wrong. Love shouldn’t be about playing games. I also really like this person and I’m just sad things are going this way. I used to be borderline, now I can only tell sometimes I still act very borderline when I fall in love. I feel like pushing people away all the time, it takes time for me to build trust.

"NYE i thought 2018 was gonna be great, I was so wrong. 7days in, FP abandoned me already. My FP abandoned me 5days ago, I guess I'm posting because I'm lost. I put everything in to her so I was nothing without her, I was crying non stop for first 3days along with my usual drug usage, just a lot more with opiates on top. I've cried past 2 days but it hasn't been constant (albeit past 2days I've been in hospital with only my phone, more on that in a min) and I'm realising how she was my FP but she was just a friend at best to me, she cut all contact and even banned me from my own mental health discord we set up together. So she has isolated me away from a groups of people I talked to. I was on a bridge the other night, I nearly jumped. I was on 40mg xanax (i have high tolerance but even that for me was barred af).

So i didn't care but i wasn't paying attention, had my phone in one hand on discord messaging a person saying it's not worth it and saying goodbye to world and next thing all i feel is load of hands just grab me from the bridge outer railing and pull me over to the safe side, it was like woah I was feeling dizzy and then i just get high vis vests in my face, that's it, i felt someone grab my phone out my hand though as I was being pulled over. 

That's the last thing I remember before being on a hospital drip, because of my benzo abuse and even when I came to I was completely distressed they had no choice but to IV me diazepam, which I'm still on now.

How did I let it get this bed, people had abandoned me and caused me isolation in this way before... she blocked me on whatsapp before all this happened etc, so although I'm in the UK and she is in the US, I still had her number tho, didn't give a fuck about the charges so just texted her directly because she said false shit about me before blocking me and considering all that I just sent ""Evil fucking bitch"" to her.

It was a non-romantic dynamic, yes I'm male and her husband is her FP but it never seemed like a problem but from what I gather he had not liked the idea of me being her FP, like I fucking choose?! Even my ex-FP said he don't really understand at all.

I keep wanting to reach out to her via her number but I've been talked out of it thankfully but I'm just destroyed, broken, worthless.

Side note, IV diazepam is lovely, but when I get off it and get home i will want my xanax pills, kpin pills and dhc opiates pills. I've never been this heartbroken, but then she said all the right things a BPD brain needs to hear, so being betrayed by that and abandoned has just made me cycle like crazy and the dysregulation is real.","The expanded size of the tensor (642) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.

"Tips/Resources/Books for living with someone with BPD A sibling of mine will need to come live with me and my spouse and they probably have BPD. Their life is a mess (severe alcoholism, needs to apply for bankruptcy, divorcing, unemployed) and it will be homelessness if we don’t help. They are currently still living with their ex- but have signed divorce papers and the discussion has been that they will try to get therapy and a part time job to stabilize somewhat before moving across the country to live at our house. I have no back up plan for them once they are here and know that they are stressful to live with for even a week (and it’s likely they will need several months of rent free co-habitation). I am very nervous about these prospects and am trying to come up with a game plan for dealing. I’m also afraid the ex- will lose patience in the meantime and just put them on a plane. I don’t want to be in a constant state of reactivity when they are here and am trying to formulate some key strategies to use for my own sanity and serenity.

Any advice from those with BPD or from those living with someone suffering BPD would be welcome. I know I am not being very specific but am just looking for anything that springs to mind for y’all. If articulating a response is clarifying for you or if you’re feeling generous then that’s awesome—not trying to come across as lazy or entitled to advice. Much appreciated!

"To those who are recovering or trying to; dealing with the guilt of self-reflection to those who hurt? The title doesn't make too much sense, I accidentally some words.  But I meant, dealing with the guilt of hurting others in the past, especially the ones you care about the most.

I've made it a practice of mine since I started DBT and other self improvement to release the guilt from all my past decisions and actions.  Not only because of the amount of progress I've made, but because it serves me no purpose to hate myself for how I treated others.  In fact, it can be overwhelming if I think about it too much.  I need to love myself, and be my own best friend, especially now.  But, I have, like many of you, an ex who I loved more than life, who I, for a lack of a better word, tortured endlessly for a year or more with the truly ugly parts of bpd and it's emotional ups and downs.  Because this ultimately drove him to no contact, understandably, I can never resolve it with him personally.  Unfortunately, in my case, this is a person who works at my office, so I see him relatively frequently.  With the knowledge of our past history, and the hindsight I now have, it's a bit of a sore spot that opens up a bit every time I see him.  And never fully closes because I can't tell him I'm sorry, because I can't tell him I get it.  Even if I did have that opportunity, it wouldn't be believable, for good reason.

Instead, I think I will show it by truly respecting his choices.  His choice to go no contact.  His choice to date someone new, to accept someone into his life who probably showed a lot of kindness to him after all my hatred.  His choice to forget the good, to forget and not care the pain it causes me.  I get it now.  I hope that my silence shows my sincerity, as difficult as it all is.  I understand now why he had to do what he did, and due to my past ignorance, lack of emotional tools, lack of being able to treat people the way they should be treated, for so long, brought me/him to this point.  I don't want to say I deserve it, because my anger and hostility and the pain I caused wasn't intentional, exactly, but I should own my responsibility in it all fully and I will only (continue to) learn from the pain.

"Ex dumped me 9 months ago out of nowhere. Still not over him :( Not sure why I'm writing this. Just want some reassurance that things will be ok i guess. 

Few days ago it was 9 months ago. We've been no-contact for 5 months because he got a new gf and it hurt me too much. I'm still obsessed and idealise him.

"First post, please help Hi there. I've been lurking around here for a while, but I just never had the balls to actually reach out to anyone. When I was 18, I went through a super rough patch, was hospitalized and was diagnosed with BPD. Because I was young and in denial, I didn't really grasp that it was actually an issue that needed to be actively worked at, and eventually stopped going to therapy and taking my medication. Now here I am, 5 years later no treatment, and kind of a complete dumpster fire. With the collapse of a 3 year long (albeit toxic) relationship in October, I've been a total disaster for the past few months. I relied on this man for everything, he completely took care of me emotionally. Now that I'm single, and really being well and single for the first time since I was 17, I have no idea what to do. I know that I need to seek therapy, and a psychiatrist, but I don't have the money nor insurance to take care of myself. I guess I'm asking if anyone can share their coping techniques, or any self help information, it would be super helpful.","[[{'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.477829247713089}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.40849944949150085}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.08929372578859329}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.05738541856408119}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.051595672965049744}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.04687386006116867}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.042816583067178726}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.03412283584475517}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.03136902675032616}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.027765318751335144}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.019318625330924988}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.015685543417930603}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.011280657723546028}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.008937680162489414}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.008151844143867493}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.0077671632170677185}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.0056324307806789875}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.005536390468478203}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.005186951253563166}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.0051710340194404125}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.005071541294455528}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.004946258384734392}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0027192130219191313}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.002608807059004903}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.0019984429236501455}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.0011727811070159078}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.0008859998779371381}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.0008416275959461927}]]"

Yes, it's fucking lonely. Yes, sometimes I worry that I'm going to be alone forever.

"Haven't talked to my BPD friend in a while. Should I reach out again? Friend has never said anything about BPD, but after thinking about all his behavior towards me and asking someone who has BPD about it, it seems that he definitely hits all the classic traits of BPD. But yes, it's always been that some day he is super affectionate with me, and some days he is very mean with me...

Anyway. I last talked to him almost a week ago. He got upset about something (I honestly don't know what, but he's had a history of suddenly withdrawing or changing his affectionate nature to cold without any warning when I talk to him sometimes) and then went offline. A couple days ago, I've tried talking to him again (and all I said was pretty much ""Hey, how are you?"") and then he went offline again. 

In the past, when I've reached out to him, he would eventually respond. And...I don't remember if we've gone this long without talking though. Could it be that he's splitting from me permanently? I don't want to lose my friend :( What should I do this time...? Any advice/help would be appreciated.

"Does anyone have periods of time where they are okay? The reason it’s been so hard for me to keep up with therapy is because I’ll go through periods where I feel totally fine and not in need of any help. I’ll feel relatively sane (except for the anxiety) and I’ll appear more or less sane to everyone around me. 

Then a huge crisis occurs and I blow up and completely change personalities and shock everyone around me and the cycle just continues over and over again.

"IOP recovery and BPD in need of opinions/to vent/one question. a little back story...not great at writing this stuff so please bare with me.

I was diagnosed with BPD about 3 years ago and have seemed treatment sense for it off and on, occasionally giving up on a therapist or just deciding to stop. I was arrested for DUI this past April, through the court process it was stated that i need to go to a inpatient rehab facility for alcoholism. I refused and was dropped from the pretrial diversion program i was in. I did at the recommendation of my attorney enter into a highly respected out patient recovery program in the town I'm from. I spent 5 or so months in this program and successfully was sober for 3 months before i relapsed (this happened within the last month). During this relapse i lost my job as a result of drinking on the job and it was decided by myself and along with my IOP group that inpatient is in fact a good option for me, and the process is underway to get into a publicly funded facility (sense i lost my job and insurance) that will be about a month so its kinda useless to look for any decent job so in an attempt to stay busy along with odd jobs i can pick up I'm spending a lot of time at coffee shops studying alcoholism and general interests. One of the things I started digging into the last couple of days is my diagnosis of BPD. When i was first diagnosed i agreed and thought it made a lot of sense but i must admit i didn't do a lot of looking at how it affected me and what exactly it meant. 

In this process of digging into BPD (I'm reading several books ((""I hate you- don't leave me"" and ""Borderline personality demystified""))as well as several good sources I've found through the books.) I am finding a lot of the things that I do can be better explained as a symptom of BPD over a symptom of alcoholism. (yes a part of me is convinced i don't have a problem and don't need IOP, but thats not what this is about). 

The therapist who runs the IOP group I'm in has been told i was diagnosed with BPD, the more i read into BPD the more i feel like he might not know exactly what that means. I have been trying to schedule appointments 1 on 1 with him and he keeps saying he will text me some dates and he has yet to do so. I am growing increasingly disappointed with his reliability and want to express this to him. I feel like he needs to be better educated on BPD but don't exactly know how to approach him on the subject. I really don't know exactly what I'm looking for in posting about this but i feel like i needed to vent. 

I guess for the sake of it I'll ask some more specific questions hopefully someone will have some inside into. 

1) Has anyone of you who suffers from BPD entered into treatment for substance abuse, how has it been helpful for you? 
A big part of me feels like I have yet to really address BPD in an appropriate way and I feel like entering in patient treatment without doing that will only be a waist of time.

"Is anybody else easily manipulated, open to suggestion. Sorry if this is vague rambling, but I don't know how to solve this. 

I'm extremely open to suggestion to people close to me. When my friends have an opinion of me, it immediately becomes a truth. I can't/don't really have an opinion about it of my own anymore somehow. For instance; the other day my friend said I gave in to my parents too much and I remember that I thought I didn't, but now I think I do and I'm starting to resent my parents for pressuring me and myself for giving in all the time, eventhough I don't know if it's true. Well, loads more examples were that came from.

The biggest problem is that this also happens in therapy. I can't hold on to what I think of something for myself. I am constantly fighting my therapists suggestions as if they are trying to take my own thoughts away from me, because that's what happens in normal life with less important things too. 

It makes me less prone to share the really important issues, because talking about it will make me confused about what is true, what are my thoughts and what are my therapists thoughts.

"Pregnant and :( I'm 35 weeks pregnant and the father and I aren't together. He's told me his family would consider it their biggest fear if we ended up together. Just now I asked if we could see each other this week and he said no, he wants to get an early night one night and he's out with friends every other night (movies, sports, dinner, art exhibition etc). He said, just tell me what you want to say now over the phone, and I said I just wanted us to talk in person, and he said suit yourself and we ended the conversation. I have no idea when we'll talk.

Up until recently I thought my mom would come over for the birth but that's off now her malignant NPD husband who severely abused me as a child/teenager is back (she has BPD and was equally abusive but I was hoping things might have changed). Nothing has changed in that situation since that time.

I feel so sad and alone. I'm trying to stay positive because I have to for the baby. I have no friends and am totally isolated. I've seen that he (the father) has notifications from dating apps on his phone when we've been together. The more upset and hormonal I get, I feel like the more pathetic and unattractive and unmotivated I am. I have a place on a college course for after the baby's born and he tells me he doesn't think it will be doable, and I have serious concerns about being able to do it with a baby. He is scheduled to get a promotion around the time the baby's due and has given me his friends' numbers to call in case I go into labor and he's not around.

"Having to be somebody else to feel better. Anybody else relate? Every time there's a character I really like in a movie or game, I WANT to look like them. I actually feel confident as them and it allows me to escape from being myself. I'm completely aware how bad this is, but it's the only way I can feel better because I do not like how I look normally. This changes yearly. Once I get bored, I will go on to another person/character. At the moment, I want to dye my hair pink because that's the colour of my favourite character's hair. I want to have the same hair style, too. I don't care about the clothes or anything. It's always just my hair and I will also wear eye contacts depending on their eye color.

"My brain is nagging me to break up with FP/Boyfriend Hello all first post here and it's already negative haha, I made this account to hopefully find solace in knowing other people who have BPD I can relate with so nice to meet you all!

Anyways I have been recently diagnosed with BPD, I will be starting therapy soon enough. My partner of about 6 months knows about this diagnosis and tries his best to be supportive and understanding for me and my behaviour, he knows about him being my FP.

I have no actual reason at all to break up with him but for some reason for about a few weeks now I keep thinking about breaking up.

I feel like this relationship is giving me anxiety but honestly he's been doing nothing but giving me amazing support, even if he's a bit brutally honest sometimes it helps me snap out of times I become emotionally irrational. And in return I want to do nothing but make him happy.

Like the only reason I want to do this is because I often get upset and blow up in tears for the most menial things. It's not even bad things he does, he's just talking to friends most of the time and I get super irrationally jealous. And every time I get upset like that I feel so guilty and he feels bad for hurting me. I just feel so toxic and abusive at times even though I know I'm not... I just keep obsessing over those times I overreacted and it's piling up on me...

I don't want to hurt him anymore which makes me think of doing this, I'm wondering should I wait until I learn to cope better and get my emotions in check before making such a harsh decision, or am I beating a dead horse out of this relationship?","[[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.34551140666007996}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.24938200414180756}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.12111476063728333}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.08978190273046494}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.0737898126244545}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.07184212654829025}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.04041963070631027}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.03710209205746651}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.036866072565317154}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.03674912825226784}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.03562818467617035}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.030657054856419563}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.025914164260029793}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.024643154814839363}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.019976060837507248}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.019883453845977783}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.015056313946843147}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.01303970254957676}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.012945516034960747}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.0079219164326787}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.007844405248761177}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.007026003208011389}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.005957091227173805}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.004840395413339138}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.00311875413171947}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0023919926024973392}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.001389736426062882}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.0004843102942686528}]]"

"First time poster seeking advice from other mothers who suffer from BPD My biggest fear in life has always been to end up just like my mother, Who suffers from BPD/narcissism. She had a horrible childhood, and was abused horribly by her father, who also suffered from BPD, and had a horrible childhood himself. I'm not going to say my mother was all bad because she wasn't, and I know she loves me but since she suffers from narcissism also, she doesn't accept she even has a problem, it's always someone else's fault and never hers. 

I cut ties with her completely after I moved out at 18, and had my first child at 19. As my first child has gotten older, I realized that I would get annoyed super fast with her, and I have said stuff to her that I do not mean, and it breaks my heart. I have almost all of the traits of BPD. I am a emotional rollercoaster. My mood is constantly changing throughout the day, the littlest things can make me go from happy, to sad, to depressed, to having suicidal thoughts. 

After reading so many comments about woman who suffer from BPD, make horrible mothers, only get worse, are horrible people, and their children are doomed, makes me have no hope and not even want to get help. I am very good at controlling my emotions around my children, although I have messed up, I have never hurt them and i try to think about everything that comes out of my mouth before I say It. I do not want my kids to grow up and feel the way I do, or have to struggle with losing their cool easily with others. 

any advice will be appreciated.

"Is it even possible to make friends when you have BPD? All my old friends won’t really talk to me anymore and I can’t figure out how to even start making new ones. I feel like maybe it’s pointless since I’ll just screw things up with them too. 

I don’t even know if it’s because of BPD or if I’m just an asshole that nobody likes.

I just wish I had at least one close friend I could talk to tonight.

"I have quiet BPD and any absolutely certain that my partner has explosive BPD. We had another big fight. I take things too deeply, then i split, then i FEEL spiteful. However, due to an abusive past and c-ptsd, I've learned to swallow my feelings to an unhealthy extent and compartmentalize like a champ. 

Right now our relationship is incredibly toxic, I've just ordered 4 books on Amazon. A DBT/CBT workbook, a book on loving someone with bpd, how to unfuck your life, and another workbook for high conflict couples. 

Have you ever been in a relationship with another bpd sufferer? At the very least someone extremely bipolar and prone to outbursts? Have you made it work, have you tried as much as i am trying? We are starting couples therapy as well. 

I'm apprehensive to call his behavior abusive because i don't really see malice, i see untempered mental illness and instability. However, I've seen through rose eyed glasses before and while im great at seeing signs of real abuse when its others, not so much myself. Right now though, i don't believe it's fair to label it as abusive. I wouldn't be opposed to reminders of what is and isn't tolerable behavior and when its time to call it quits. 

I just need some perspective. Experience. To commiserate? Even advice would be nice, but mostly right now I'm drowning, confused, and need to be heard, to be validated.

TL;DR - HOLY SHIT RELATIONSHIPS. I MEAN WTF.

"please I need advise... I really need help writing a letter to someone. 


The reality of the situation is she got a boyfriend, and they fell madly in love and attached at the hip (as most couples do) and she didn’t have as much time for me. 


But my perception of it for the last year and a half was she completely forgot about me, I never meant anything at all to her, and all my feelings are just burden to people and people think I’m annoying and delusional.



To some it up, I told her to forget my name and number and that she ever knew me a year and a bit ago and I haven’t been able to fucking stop thinking about it since. It really doesn’t help that my sister is best friends with her and I can’t just not hear from her ever (I don’t have social media because it is VERY bad for my mental and emotional well being) also that I am completely and utterly avoidances personality because I feel people never truly love or care for me and will always just leave me always, so its easier to just be alone and too scary to be intimate and I can’t even when I try to be authentic so relationships are just draining and painful. This situation hasn’t helped with that obviously.


The last month though I’ve finally been prescribed some anti-depressants and a pill for dissociation and talking with a therapist again. I’m starting to feel a little saner, thank fuck. 


My therapist asked me if I could to write a letter as if I were to actually write and send this letter to said friend. 
Reality is I would reach out to this community for support and advise so here I am. 


Its hard for me to remember the massive tsunami wave of emotions I have and have had for over a year relative to this because of the medication and not being in a triggered state for the last week. But I really do want to write a letter expressing myself and letting her know that its not her fault. I know that its me and I have a lot of work to do to challenge myself into a better place so I don’t make this same mistakes again. I’ve had a similar situation with my mom in the past which carried on for years and still to this day where I carried actually life threating hurt inside me. I don’t feel I can move on without making some type of amends with her. I've been having suicidal thoughts all steming from this for a year and need to move on. 

a few weeks ago I was triggered because my sister was in town so I was able to go on her phone and creep people on Facebook and I creeped this friend and she seemed so great and happy and thriving without me. I’m not upset that she’s happy. I care about her and I’m happy she’s happy. It just that I feel so god damn unlovable, sick and diseased. No one will ever be able to love me. 


I have no idea her perception of all this because we really haven’t spoken in the year and a half. 

I made a post a short while ago relative to this but didn’t get any comments you can read that if you’d like:

I just need help. Please any thoughts are helpful. Thank you

"BPD is costing me my job. Looking back at all of my relationships, work, personal, etc. I feel like everything was a trainwreck.

The only one I'm willing to discuss today is more on a professional level because it's my livelihood. I never had a good working relationship with anyone. I had this honeymoon phase with someone when I first start at a company, then slowly turn sour as I get to know people.

In my current situation, my emotions got out of whack, I went to see a psychiatrist, got medicated, but no proper diagnosis. My emotions are everywhere and uncontrollable. I ended up being intellectually slow which is costing me my job. Since I disclosed my disability to my employer, they can't fire me under Human Rights, but I feel humiliated and traumatized by my whole situation. They have been trying to get me fired. I saw evidence of a case they are building on me.

My PMs have been setting me up for failure. All achievements are negligible. Anything tiny that I have done wrong puts them in a hissy fit and magnifies my mistakes by 100x. I wasn't given everything that I needed, I wasn't trained properly to do xyz, they won't help me when I ask for it. They've been pushing me into a corner to get me to quit.

I'm away on medical leave and I can't even bring myself to think about going back to work. With Canadian healthcare, it's a year long wait to get treatment.

How do I explain to a therapist what seems to be wrong, without skewing my symptoms so I get the answers I want or expect? I want to get something out of it this time.

"Barely getting through the day. Pretty straightforward. Mourning love lost has to be the hardest thing I’ll have to do this year and I’m not fairing well at all. I can’t get out of bed without crying. I’ve shunned all of my family and friends. I’ve stopped doing things that bring me joy. I feel bleak. I feel lost and alone and defeated and broken. I don’t know what to do. The pain gnaws at my heart every waking moment and alcohol seems to be the only thing that can quiet my volatile thoughts and insatiable cries. 

We don’t do well with abandonment and rejection and good byes. Hopefully someone here can relate. Anyone that has ever truly loved another human and lost them will relate to this, probably. I just want him back. But I can’t always get what I want. And it’s killing me. I want to tear my hair out and cry until I lose my voice. And curse the fucking universe for dealing me these bullshit cards. And telling god to go fuck himself for putting the most amazing human being in my life, only to tear him the fuck away from me. And to genetics for making me into the insecure, explosive asshole that drove him away. Fuck.

"I wrote a poem describing my struggles with BPD. It talks about using art as a way to cope with the constant emotional pain. A stare into space 
A wrinkle on your face 
Sends me into panic 
A feeling I've learned to embrace 

Did I stutter 
Did I groan 
Did I hurt you 
I hear your moan 

The paranoia and dread 
Fill the brim of my head 
Like an old glass of wine 
Bubbling over with red 

I go back to my cave 
I sit and think awhile 
But nothing is resolved 
So I give the mirror a smile 

It's all I can think to do 
To tame the taunting bruise 
Of thoughts past and present 
Of neuroses forever new 

My cave is where I sleep 
But rest I cannot keep 
I wake with achy eyes 
A fate I gladly reap 

But maybe the lack of sleep 
The rest I cannot keep 
Will be buffered slightly by 
The gift that I must reap 

Maybe that gift is cursed 
Maybe it's all for naught 
But the aching obsession remains
To fight for what's been fought

Beauty is in the mind 
It's not out there to find 
So here in my cave I'll rest 
And fight for one more time

"Do you have hallucinations, delusions, and paranoia? Hello all. First time posting here, so hopefully this is okay. First of all, I know absolutely nothing about BPD besides what I've read on wikipedia. I was diagnosed with schizoaffective about a decade ago and that's been my stable diagnosis since then. I recently started seeing a new psychiatrist. She says it could be borderline. From what I've read, the symptoms don't seem to match. The reason that I've been diagnosed with schizoaffective is that I hallucinate and have delusions and paranoia. From what I've read, that's not characteristic of BPD. Am I wrong? Do any of you hallucinate or have paranoia and delusions as part of your BPD?","[[{'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.6051914095878601}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.3109723627567291}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.2623940706253052}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.09216984361410141}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.07107578217983246}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.05962352454662323}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.027738986536860466}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.017312178388237953}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.015019671060144901}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.01194688305258751}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.010069018229842186}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.009868830442428589}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.008031755685806274}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.007474229205399752}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.006986237596720457}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.006089339964091778}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.006002281326800585}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.005722861737012863}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.005678934510797262}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.004287471063435078}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.0035570387262851}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.002519943518564105}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.0019156420603394508}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.0018462692387402058}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.001281335367821157}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.0012753511546179652}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.0012265413533896208}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.0006428493652492762}]]"
"Needing to be needed, and then proving why others can't trust needing you in the first place. I have to call myself out on my behaviour and talk myself down from whatever moment I just had. The Mrs is going through something traumatic for the past month or so. It's been a nightmare and I've not been much help to her, though she'll say otherwise (emotional support and that). Her strength has been something else!  Through everything, she's been fierce protective of her close circle, when it should be the other way around. 

Tonight was no different. She's getting ready to take on another round of legal phone calls tomorrow, pertaining to injury sustained and medical costs. She's doing her best to not worry me over finances. I'm feeling useless once more, and decide to treat us to some Italian takeaway once finished with work. I get home and realize I'm after leaving the food I'd picked up for us in the cab home. Food left in cab = none of this would have happened if she didn't make me feel so goddamned useless = I lost my absolute shit on her and threatened to leave her since she didn't need me and could handle herself so well without me.

So here I am, after roaring it all out, ordering us another round of dinner and having the absolute mother of all anxiety attacks over going back home.  She was crying when I left. I feel like an absolute c*nt.  And I don't know what to say for myself when I get home.  I'd never leave her, I don't know why I even said such a horrible thing. But I felt that way in that moment. Was that splitting?

"It's happening again. It's ruining me. I met this guy online, he's in florida I'm in the UK. Everything was great at first. He was the sweetest ever. Understood me. Took the time to talk me down when I was upset. 

Now it's like am just a chore to him. Past month I've realised how little he wants to talk to me. I'll still texts saying he love me, but he'll always use convo stoppers, just sent one word replies and shit. 

He never calls me anymore. We used to video chat for like 10 hours everyday. The past 2 weeks I've spoke to him for about 20mins. When I ask he says he's not feeling well, or he's busy. 

I tried my best to keep it all in. Up until I received the daily 'I love you' text today, and I tried to create conversation and all he replies is a love heart emoticon. So went crazy. I couldn't not. Out of my control. This guy is the love of my life. He is clearly drifting away. So I said 'HAHA YEAH HI, LOVE YOU, BYE. NOT EVEN SPOKE TO YOU IN OVER A WEEK. YEAH FUCK ME OFF' 

And then he was like 'wtf. Seriously wtf? I'm sick of your abusiveness, why do you think we never speak anymore'

Well.... I can't work out what it is I do that is abusive, like I constant say nice things to him. This sent me over the edge I was like 'well that's all I need to know. Bye I'll be off. Fuck this world'

And so he calls me, it's like I have to threaten suicide to get him to speak to me. And he's being so nice. He's telling me I just need to relax and breathe. He says no matter how much I push him away that he's not going anywhere. We spoke for a whole 20 mins, I began to calm down he said he loves me and thinks about me constantly. Then he was like 'hey I'm just gonna eat some food and I'll call you right back, ok love you'

7 hours I have been waiting for this dick shit to call me. Every time. This keeps happening. I was literally sat waiting. I thought right, this is pure taking this piss. And so I have text him saying 'this is not enough, you're making me worse and I love you so much which is why this is not working'.

2 hours ago I sent that. He's not even read it yet. He doesn't work, it's not like he's busy. He just sits at home watching tv. 9 hours ignored for someone who apparently 'is constantly thinking of me'. Bullshit. He'll pretend he fell asleep or something, honestly from what he texts me he is literally only awake 1 hour per day. Which I find very unlikely. 

I feel like saying a whole lot more to him. But I'm trying my best to stay sane. But I think it's past that point. 

I regret sending that last text. Damn I'm so on the edge. Like he was my way out of the crap life I am living. He is my everything. I love him so much and this is what I get.

Damn I just want to die. I can't keep doing this. All my relationships I'm fucking up and I don't know what I'm doing. Now I'm losing this amazing guy. I just want to kill myself right now.

"Musicians, Music and BPD For a long time I have wondered how many creative people, especially song writers have diagnosed/undiagnosed Borderline PD. It’s well known that many people with bipolar are highly creative. But I often think about borderline creativity, especially when it comes to music. If you think about the lyrics  in popular music, that everyone relates to, because it totally explains how they feel, it all seems to come from such a Borderline perspective; The  deep emotion expressed in music and lyrics; the songs about the euphoria of falling in love and the pain and devastation of breakups, and the general drama of relationships. I often listen to music, and think this song must have been written by someone with BPD.....normals don’t feel emotions this intensely!

"Can't stop checking up on ex FP's instagram Its been about 1.5 years since I was cut off from my FP.  Weird situation but he was a married man, which was trouble waiting to happen.  He was my best friend for 2 years prior to messing around though....  I took things too far with him and his wife cut me off from him.  Last time I saw him we had a huge fight and he treated me like garbage.  He was so fed up with me that he told his wife everything.  He regretted it later as he tried to make amends with me. We were such close friends too.  He didn't block me on instagram though.

Anyway Its painful because I see everything he's up to, and he's slowly accomplishing all of his life dreams. He seems to love his wife again too, but she is controlling so he might just be trying to stay on her good side.  I know that he misses my friendship because he still hints at inside jokes we used to have on his posts.  It's really messed up because I hate him for being an abusive asshole but I also miss him.  I wish I was a strong enough person to move on but every day is mental hell.  My happiness is directly correlated to his life..the better he is doing, the worse i feel.  Ive lost most of my friends because of my avoidance, and I don't know who I am.  I wish I could just be like him....compartmentalize my bad feelings, work on my hobbies and move on.  But I'm just a weird anomaly of depression, emptiness, and contradictions.  I also cannot stop thinking horrible things about his wife...I know that it doesn't matter but I keep thinking immature shit about her looks...she's really not attractive at all and I know that he is ashamed to be seen with her.  I even wrote his wife an apology a few months ago, and she accepted it.  But I feel fake because I still dislike her and even if I was to see him again I'd have to spend time with her.  

I'm 25/F and he's almost 40. I just want to be free from this hell and accept the fact i'll probably never see him again.  He was the closest friend I ever had, I wish I never took it so far.  He used to tell me that I was the most amazing person he's ever met, and I felt the same about him.  Put sex into the equation and I turn into a devil woman.  I’ll never find anyone as unique and funny as he was. I’m an oddball and I’ve always had trouble connecting with others.  I’m a very attractive woman but all of the men I’m interested in are unobtainable. My future looks very lonely, just me hanging out here with my mom well into my 30s.","The expanded size of the tensor (614) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.

"DEA not know what happy should feel like? Ok so for me happy is either like a nice warm glow where I feel like nothing could hurt me and all is right in the world, which I think is the more normal happy... or I get really restless exited happy where I feel like I should be talking to everyone and the tiniest thing will make me laugh.. like I can't sit still and end up coming across as almost hyperactive. 

Then I get happy then upset, or more commonly happy then really anxious haha..

"Do you know any natural remedy? I've been diagnosed with BPD long time ago. Now I'm not in therapy, I can't afford a psychiatrist even if I'd like to, but I'm not doing any better.

My mood swings are seriously invalidating, I feel anxious because I don't know how I'm going to be next morning. I can't be constant, can't make plans, because my mood goes up and down every fucking day, it's restless. I don't know what causes this, because, honestly, I feel good, I feel positive, I want to do things -- except that I can't, because when I'm low (like now) my mind is useless, I try all day to be productive, but it's like trying to fly when you're a fish.

I can't handle it anymore. There are so many things I'd want to do, but I feel caged, my mood is not mine. Why am I suddenly depressed if nothing, literally NOTHING, has happened, for fuck's sake?????
I'm so angry!

So, the question: is there any natural remedy that works for you?

"I think I have BPD, not sure what to do with this information. So I think I have BDP, I have been suspecting this for a while. My sister has it, and I'm pretty sure that some of the drama and alcoholism in my extended family might possibly be expression of this, at the very least there is a lot of addictions, mental illness and trauma in my family in general. After a big crying fight with my husband this morning, I told him I was scared and that I think I might have BPD. My husband, who is a social worker (kind of) works with a lot of people with mental health issues, asked me to sit down, and said ""I know, I've been wondering that for over a year now, and the behaviours go back even further."" He says that he doesn't know if I have BDP but that I have a lot of the traits (I'm good at stable relationships even though I tend to push people away). 

It's like I'm in control 90-95% of the time, but like 5-10% of the time I just lose it. I am an inconsolable anxious wreck and I will just talk and say terrible hurtful things until someone shuts me up, leaves the room, or I literally run out of breath/saliva/voice/etc. This always just leaves me exhausted. This combined with issues around abandonment (and once I am sure someone won't abandon me I start becoming afraid that they're going to die on me and start saving voicemails and things from them, and start telling them that I love them all the time incase they die while walking home or something). I also learned that this feeling of emptiness and constant longing for something is not something felt by all humans all the time (go figure?). All of this on top of childhood trauma, and a generally difficult (but really rewarding) life, and it sounds like I this sub might be for me.

The good news is that I have a good support network, a psychologist, and a family doctor. After two years of trying and failing to address some of the issues in my life, things are starting to turn around. I was finally diagnosed with ADHD in November, and now that I'm taking medication for that I am starting to feel like I have the energy to deal with my other issues in life. This sounds like it is going to be a big one to work on. I don't really know what to do with this info, I'm going to talk to my psychologist, but truth be told I am already exhausted from getting this far. The idea of working on me over the next few years to deal with this sounds like a huge task, and I don't want to take on yet another thing, but I'm hoping by dealing with this, dealing with my trauma, maybe I won't be such a mess 5-10% of the time, and I can actually learn to grow in my personal life.

Even though there's BDP in my family, I can't really talk to anyone about it. As I'm fairly new with all of this, are there any tips or techniques that you've found that help? Is there anyway that works for you to regain composure while you watch yourself being an unreasonable jerk?

tldnr; my husband and myself suppect I have BDP for a number of reasons. I have a doctor, psychologist, and support network. Not sure what to do, besides talk to them. Any suggests or tips for dealing with BDP/emotions that take over your life?","The expanded size of the tensor (740) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.

"Does anyone else notice they’ve changed friends groups way too many times in the last few years Does anyone else with BPD notice they’ve changed friends groups way too many times in the last few years? Like I’m never the reason for the friend group to “drift apart” but since I was 15 (21 now) I’ve had 8 different friends groups and each time my personality and taste in shit fit in whatever the group mainly was like even tho I’m still kinda the same. Some people have moved with me through friend groups but it’s so weird never having a single friend group to grow with like my little sister has done since she was in 6th grade (senior in HS now) or how my mom has had the same friends for 20 years now (some since she was 16 years old). I feel I’ll never have a friend that’s with me my whole life and it sucks. Even the friend groups Im apart of I’ve always felt like I’m the least cared about one and the one that has to push everyone to invite her and care about her. Blah.

"Literal fear of abandonment as a kid When I was still very small my parents used to go out at night for work and leave me alone in the dark house, assuming I was sleeping but I always woke up and desperately searching for them. This was usually very traumatizing to me. I thought I was lost forever.


When we were out, and they told me to wait for them alone for a few minutes or I lost them, I had such huge panic attack that I started screaming and crying like I was about to die. It also always happened if they took a few minutes longer to show up at school for picking me up etc... My reaction happened almost automatically. When I was a bit older I always begged them to stay home with me. 
No need to tell you how annoyed they were about all this.

"Constant Validation So, one of the things about this community, is that it never ceases to amaze me just how much in common we all have. I mean, some of the shared behavior is really obvious, and it doesn't really surprise me that I read people writing about these similar learned behaviors. Then other little, more obscure things that I thought were super weird, and unique to me, come up in here. 

My latest obsession, and believe me, everything I enjoy in life at one time or another, becomes totally fascinating by me, at best...or a profound obsession/addiction...is online dating. I'm sure some of you know when you get a notification on your phone that you got a ""like"" or a response to one of your Facebook posts, your brain is sent a certain signal, associated with love/attention.

I had a trauma in 2009...barely left my house for 8 years, sometimes not talking to any other humans for months. My facebook likes/comments were checked and counted very frequently, Reddit upvotes were important to me for e.g. 3 days ago, I joined some dating sites..Besides work and spending time with people to that I'm obligated to...all I have done is check who has ""liked"" me, ""super liked"" me, messages me, viewed me, winked at me, us ""interested in me..you get the picture. Anyone else have a similar experience?? I feel like online dating/ having BPD are a potentially toxic mix. Not going to lie though..it's freaking awesome waking up everyday to compliments, even if they are lies or hyperbole by total strangers lol.

I'd like to add that one of my close friends has recently been diagnosed with BPD, and imo it's a severe case..I told her this place was a loving and helpful community...just wanted you guys to know..how truly appreciative I am if this group, and everyone who contributes to it.

"Workplace issues Hi my fellow BPDlers,
I’ve been lurking a bit since I got my diagnosis in October, but now I feel the need to talk to people that actually get how I feel.
I’ve had borderline forever as I would say based on how I was as a child and teenager, I’m now 26 and struggle with anxiety, depression, eating disorders, self-destruction through substance and exposure to emotionally unhealthy situations and relationships. 
But through it all I’ve been working on a career, got my degree three years ago and started working in my field. 
Ever since the pressures of the adult life really started after Uni I’ve been getting worse and worse.
I got into two unstable and abusive relationships, the most recent one with a narcissistic bipolar man who manipulated me through cutting himself infront of me, biting and hitting me and getting me pregnant (yes I accept my responsibility in all of it) had me abort the baby and treating my without any respect while claiming he loved me. I was addicted to the pain and suffering but I went to work... 
i had panic attacks and cried on the office toilets floor, I showed back up to work an hour after my abortion and when I finally got into therapy and tried to call in sick for a while, I was pressured by my boss to come back to work ASAP.
I have been making a couple of mistakes when I wasn’t concentrating enough, I was scolded everytime and people at my work treat you like you personally insulted them If you mess up so everyone is walking on egg shells.
I started taking Prozac in December and had some more issues while adjusting but over Christmas I’ve felt like it was finally working for me. When I came back to work, I had an email that said I’ve been officially warned, as there was another mistake in my work from before Christmas which cost them 1,5 k and they demand an explanation for how this could have happened and I need to structure a plan as to how to avoid mistakes in the future. 
Now I’m crumbling again had a panic attack on the bathroom floor again and had to write an email explaining how I’m sick, am taking medication that’s fogging my mind sometimes and how I’m working on getting better.
I’ve been trying to find another workplace and get my career forward but this is all so hard!!! 
I beat myself up about being useless and incapable and I’ve already started to embrace the hunger pains again, so I guess I’m back to starving myself after being better for a while. 
Has anyone had issues at work and needed to explain themselves? Can we still have a career?","The expanded size of the tensor (576) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.  Target sizes: [1, 576].  Tensor sizes: [1, 514]"
"I've forgotten how intense the fear of abandonment is I've been dating this guy from one of my classes for the last month. I've known him for six months and we were pretty good friends before we dated. When I met him, his girlfriend had just moved to China for a job opportunity and would be there indefinitely. They broke up because they couldn't do long distance.

When we started dating, I asked him if this would be a problem and he assured me that he was over her. I believed him. We spent a lot of time together and I got really attached to him. I was head-over-heels for this guy.

Today, he told me about a dream he had, where his ex was back. He was so happy to see her. He told me that all of the feelings for her came back full-force. He was crying because he didn't want to hurt me, but ultimately, we broke up because he didn't think this was fair to me. I don't blame him. I just wish I'd seen it coming because I'm not surprised something like this would happen.

Logically, I get it. I respect and even appreciate his decision to do this. But holy shit, I had the worst panic attack in a while when I got home I didn't dare cry in front of him because I knew if I did, I wouldn't stop. I want to vomit and throw myself off a building. My brain kept telling me ""You're clingy and fat and ugly, you're unlovable and he was looking for the easy way out. Why would anyone want to be in a relationship with you"" I felt like the crippling fear of being alone forever was going to kill me right there. I almost wish it did. 

I'm okay now. I'm still really upset about it and have been crying on and off all day. I know this will pass and I'll probably be okay in a week, but I hate this shit. It was only a month, and I got so attached to him. He became my favorite person instantly and I'm craving attention from him now. I need to give him space though. I don't want to hurt him. I want him to want to talk to me.

I hope we can get back together eventually, but i have no idea if that's even in the cards. He told me he still had feelings for me but I don't know if that means we could ever try again.

How do you guys deal with short flings ending and the hyper-attachment? ","The expanded size of the tensor (534) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.  Target sizes: [1, 534].  Tensor sizes: [1, 514]"
"Anyone else not know they're sexuality?  I genuinely am not sure of my sexual orientation. In high school I dated a few boys but I never cared for any of them. Whenever they tried to be romantic with me, trying to touch or kiss me, it would absolutely infuriate me. Like I would be seething with rage at even the thought of it.
   I thought I might be a lesbian because I generally feel more comfortable around girls and think they are generally better looking than guys. But I recently dated and had sex with a girl and I didn't really like it much either. The thing is though being a girl doesn't make me angry like being with a guy does. Just thinking about having sex with a guy makes me want to smash my fist against a wall.

"Opening Up about BPD in a relationship ? I recently started my first relationship at 22 which has been a roller coaster to begin with. I struggled identifying with being borderline at first bc I couldn't recognize my difficulties with interpersonal relationships.

Well, now I do. Sometimes I feel absolutely crazy and try to pull myself away from him, but that makes him feel worse. And when I feel the need to lash out or he frustrates me, I automatically want to end things.

Sometimes I consider ending things to protect him from myself and dealing with me. I just started my recovery when we started talking and didn't plan on getting into anything until I was on more stable footing with myself.

I've been attempting to be open about my disorder, and sometimes things come up that are related to BPD. But sometimes I worry that he thinks I'm blaming my behavior on it or talking about it too much or it doesn't matter in the conversation ....... and it's a very hard disorder to describe. And there are times he'll ask me about how I feel about certain things or myself and want to explain that my particular struggle with it has to do with BPD, but kind of feel like I'm faking it when I do?

It also infuriates me when he says ""I feel that too"" bc he DOES NOT or certainly not in the same way or extent, but don't know how to voice that this is invalidating to me without invalidating his own struggles. 

I am rambling! But any advice on how to open up to your partner about this? Or what you need?

"Mood &amp; thought shifts so quickly — therapy questions? It’s been getting worse lately. Depression and thoughts come and I’ll obsess over them in my head. Before you know it, I’ve convinced myself that I’m perfectly fine. And the cycle continues. People think I’m overreacting when I try to vent. I AM overreacting but they don’t think there’s anything really wrong with me.

For those who have sought therapy, was it effective for you? I don’t have a lot of extra money to spend, so I wouldn’t be able to visit a therapist more than once or twice a month. Is this enough?

"Has anyone else cheated and not really cared? *I know this post makes me sound like an enormous asshole, which I am, but I know sometimes people with BPD have infidelity issues, so I wanted to ask here.

I have BPD. I've done years of therapy...talk therapy, self-read DBT books (the DBT group class was full), CBT, etc.

Dealing with BPD and realizing the totality of who I am and all the deep shame and guilt has been an exhausting process. Every day I have to try to regulate myself in interactions with people I'm close to. I'm great with coworkers and friends, but people I'm closer to, it's much more of a struggle, as it is for a lot of us.

I was in a two-year relationship with someone with BPD who grew up in an abusive family, and the sex was awful. But I never, ever cheated on him or ever would cheat on him, because I know how much pain he went through in his life, and even if he never found out, I could not deal with the pain of possibly contributing more pain to his life.

He ended up cheating on me, and it broke my heart.

I'm seeing someone new now, who knows about my BPD. He's much stronger, much more emotionally mature. He's really great to me. But we're in a long-distance relationship. And it kind of scares me how good he is at reading me. I feel more transparent and vulnerable around him.

Last night I cheated on him by deliberately making out with someone I had seen years ago. I don't think it had to do with the internal emptiness; it was just nice and relaxing to have that physical release from sex and cuddling. 

It felt good. After the wreckage of my BPDxBPD relationship that ended with him cheating on me, it felt good and almost strong in a way to do this. I know rationally this doesn't make any sense. After so much therapy and self-discovery and pain, it felt good to go back to the way I was before, when I had less insight and felt more free in some ways. Free from knowledge. It also felt like an internal push away from my current partner, because how close we had become was scaring me. 

I don't really feel guilty about cheating. I know I should feel guilty. 

Has anyone else cheated on their partners? And what are your thoughts on it? ","The expanded size of the tensor (531) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.  Target sizes: [1, 531].  Tensor sizes: [1, 514]"
"Is friendship with my FP at a loss? A friend of mine had been my FP for a few months, starting since we've met at college.

It sounds like he needs space, which is fine but we ultimately cannot avoid each other since we're part of the same friend group and are going on a trip together in a week.

"Nothing like an email from your boss to send your day into the fucking trash. Just back from holiday vacation with family, one of the few sources of happiness in my life right now. I got the flu on the drive back (cross country trip) so I had to take quite a few sick days stuck in a hotel, 12 hours from home. Missing work already gives me enough anxiety so, believe me when I say that it was no extended vacation.

In almost all cases, getting back to work after vacation is difficult to manage. I never feel like I have all my energy, in fact it usually feels like the opposite. Today this was especially true. I've missed a lot of work being sick last week, so I had a lot to do today without any of the necessary energy to accomplish it. I had it in my head that I wasn't going to let myself split, and that I'd work as hard as I could and go home and be at least somewhat satisfied that I did what I could today.

That is until the end of the day rolls around and my boss emails me about how I am ""waaaaaay behind"" and that I need to catch up. That's all it takes. Just one sentence, with his dumbass signature right underneath it in case I wasn't sure of who sent it. There goes any hope I had of feeling good about myself today. 

I mean, no shit, I was fucking sick.

"How do you guys control your impulses? Lately I’ve noticed that my spontaneity is out of the roof. At the time, things seem like I’m just being young and fun. Other times I manage to convince myself that I’ve wanted to do the impulsive activity my entire life. For instance, last week I was feeling low, so I just went out and got my nipples pierced.

"Any job ideas for someone incapacitated easily? (Canada) Tldr; Please share your success stories because I need some hope right now. Specifically im trying to find a  career that only takes 2 yrs of schooling, pays okay, and that I can work part time because my BPD makes full time work impossible. 

I'm currently working in retail.

At one point I had plans of becoming a medical laboratory technician. Chose it because you can work part time, it only takes 2 years of schooling, the pay is good, and employment rates are pretty high. These are all things I look for because BPD makes it next to impossible to handle stress. I barely survived this christmas in retail just working 20-25 hrs a week :/

But then I found out lab tech shifts would be varied schedule wise, like one night I might work 12 am-8 am and the next shift would be an afternoon shift.

I couldnt do that. If i stay up past a certain point i have a breakdown and i take sleeping+anxiety meds every night that I can't skip :/

Now I'm trying to look into jobs to go to school for that pay well but I'm basically useless. I likely couldn't handle a large amount of schooling. 2 years full time would be my max, or 4 years of part time, but thats iffy.

Ive looked into being a massage therapist but I dont think I can give hours of massages a day because I get physically exhausted easily :/ and it looks like the town where I live is dominated by wellness centers so I don't know how I could  make a living as an individual therapist.

I thought about teaching, since I've been told I'm articulate, I give good (specific, balanced) criticism, and it doesn't seem so physically exhausting, but apparently the hours get crazy, like majority of teachers spend an extra 15+ hours a week doing lesson plans and grading, unpaid, because you cant really get it done during the school day :/ plus its like 4 hours minimum to get a teaching degree and Im not sure I could handle being around a bunch of rowdy, mean teenagers.

I feel so awful. I know people are going to come here and say i have lots of time to figure it out or something but honestly, because I make so little money in part time retail, I'm basically mooching off of my boyfriend of 5 years. Im a native american woman and the stereotype makes me want to kill myself. I feel like I'll never find a good job because BPD makes me so useless :'(

Im a really creative person with a amall amount of skill in drawing and writing, but I'm not talented enough to have it as a full time job. (Even if I was you dont make much money from that unless youre super lucky) Im pretty friendly and good at customer service, and I like analyzing and organizing things. 

Is there anyone here who has a job that they like and pays well? Is there a different approach I can take? Any success stories in general?

Edit:idk now im going back to massage therapist. If i work like 13 hours a week rn in retail i make like 170/week not oncluding taxes. But if i was a massage therapist charging like 100 for a massage I could do like 3 massages a week and make twice as much almost??? I could soace it out for like 1 massage a day and maybe after a uear I'd have enough clients for that???? Im so confused right now...","The expanded size of the tensor (749) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.  Target sizes: [1, 749].  Tensor sizes: [1, 514]"
"Perverting healthy DBT skills into dangerous fantasies. One of the most persistent urges I give into is excessive time spent indulging fantasies. Especially when experiencing a lot of stress, I will pace back and forth fantasizing how things should have gone, or could go. I will tell myself I'm being ""mindful"" by rehearsing a scenario so as to be skillful in the moment, but really I know I want to experience whatever in my head. I like to be a victim in the scenarios or the tragic hero. (what follows is a recent experience to illustrate)

An example is that by being truthful during an annual physical at the Veterans Administration, I was flagged for suicidal ideation. While they were caring and professional I felt humiliated and their approach was more focussed on being efficient than effective. I got very depressed over the situation and spent a couple of weeks in a rut. Decided the best thing to do was advocated for myself utilizing the DEARMAN strategy for objective effectiveness. While identifying objectives and journaling the experience, I spent much time fantasizing how they would respond. Everything from offering me a job as a patient advocate, to being humiliated at a Congressional hearing, and some Kim Jung Un-like ambitions because nothing makes me feel more alive than danger!

"Scared all the time? Anyone else just scared and paranoid all the time? I have a studio apartment for the sole reason that I would be terrified if I had multiple rooms because I can’t see every corner of the room at all times. I’m afraid all the time that someone’s out there to kill me. 

For example, I’ll be in my apartment at night, facing away from the door/most of the room, and even though I *know* there’s no one in my apt, I get scared and turn around constantly to check. 
In addition, I’m staying at my parents house for winter break (I’m in college) and I am absolutely terrified to go downstairs at night. I’m also terrified to be alone in the house, even during the day. I even get scared to stay in my boyfriends apartment alone. 

I know it’s illogical. I live in a safe area and I’ve never been given any reason to be afraid. I know there’s no killer waiting for me in the dark corners of the house. I just can’t seem to get over my fear. 

What’s worse, I really love horror movies/shows/stories but I think they’re starting to get to me.

"Sex, BDSM, and BPD Preface: Hi r/BPD. I've posted here a few times. Since this is an alt, I forget about my posts until months later and then get overwhelmed by the amount of comments, so I apologize if it seems like I drop off after posting. I guess it seems that way 'cause it is, but I just wanted to give a little explanation and a heads up that I may not respond quickly, but I'm going to try this time! And also, for the story, I am a 26y/o female.

Real talk: I've noticed that since I've been starting to see my therapist and I'm doing some actual healing, practicing mindfulness and actually taking care of myself, I've not felt the need to practice BDSM and to ""submit"" like I used to. I put submit in quotations because it was never me submitting; it was me giving myself to strangers to be used, because I didn't care about myself and I felt that was truly all I was worth. Because of how early I was introduced to sex, my parents' neglect, and having the internet at my fingertips with a constant need for attention, I grew up believing I was simply a sexual object, that I had nothing else to offer.

I started getting into BDSM when I was 15. I came across some stuff online and realized I was a submissive: I loved taking orders, proving myself. (Honestly, by 15, I was already incredibly sexually active, mostly with older men who should *not* have been interacting with me.) It was a way for me to be vulnerable, like an actor assuming a role, and it got me the attention I craved. I became a model submissive. For years, I was active on FetLife and in chats, going to play parties, seeking Doms, debasing myself online for strangers that didn't care for some false sense of validation.

And it was a hell of a rollercoaster ride. Subdrop always came and always destroyed me. I was manipulated and emotionally abused by ""Doms"" that were simply misogynists in black leather. I used to say, ""I'll never be with someone who isn't a Dom."" But all the Doms I met and played with, never stuck around. They were never *with me*. I wanted the relationship, the romance and intrigue, but all I got were one night stands with men that only came around to use me because I was so needy and so willing.

When I was 18 I began suspecting I had BPD after coming across an article about it. It wasn't confirmed for me until I was 23. I've always been really introspective, enough to recognize that I had *more* than depression, but not enough to recognize that by participating in BDSM and making it my identity, I was really damaging myself.

Things began spiraling downward when I was 24. I was drinking so much it was affecting my job. I started ""escorting"" on Craigslist and backpage. I quit my job, lost my apartment, but I kept selling myself and spending most of when I made on alcohol. I got involved with a really shitty dude that was into DDlg and encouraged my escorting. He was emotionally abusive and financially manipulative. He would send me an allowance but use it as leverage during arguments to say awful things to me.

I dropped him. I kept escorting for a while until I stopped getting business. I'd gained so much weight, I wasn't looking or feeling good. It was just bad. I turned inward and began drinking even more and eating my feelings in fast food. I ended up at my highest weight at 252lbs in May.

Also in May of 2017, I started a really good job with a well-known university. Pretty good for someone who didn't graduate high school. But I was struggling with the responsibility, putting tons of pressure on myself to not lose this job like I lost all the others. I think I began developing Impostor syndrome, where I felt like I didn't deserve the job and at any moment they were going to fire me because they'd realize I wasn't good enough. I started seeing a therapist, and though I still shut down and quit that job, she's helped immensely. Now I'm working on getting my foundation fixed up and in order. I'm down 26lbs by drastically cutting back drinking and paying more attention to what I'm eating. It's helped a ton with my self-esteem.

As I'm getting older and trying to heal, it's becoming more apparent to me that BDSM, and sex in general, is linked to my illness. One night stands, getting drunk and going home with strangers, engaging in hardcore stuff on the first meetup.... not healthy habits. It's taken a long, long time to realize that. I'm not sure if there have been any studies on the correlation, but I'm drawing one based on my experience. I'm hoping that sharing my thoughts may help others who could be struggling with the same.

You're worth more than what you can provide sexually. It's empowering when you truly start believing that.","The expanded size of the tensor (1072) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.  Target sizes: [1, 1072].  Tensor sizes: [1, 514]"
"You all saved my life. Tl;dr I found this subreddit, discovered what I really had, and significantly helped myself in doing so.

As a young child i had some very severe mental and physical trauma. This led to what i believed for many years to just be severe depression and ADD. I never accounted for however, the constant indescribable loneliness, or the fits of reckless behavior I’d have. I thought i was just a freak, and the stigma my family has with mental illnesses certainly never helped. There was never a doubt in my mind that i would one day end my life. However, then i found your community while browsing on reddit and i just cried tears of joy for hours for finally understanding myself. I instantly set myself towards forgiving everyone who attributed towards my childhood trauma and understanding the reasons they did what they did. Instantly my symptoms were significantly less severe. So i just want to say thank you, and please keep this community alive and strong, because I would have never found this out without you.

Oh and for the record I do plan on following up with a professional opinion and seeking any additional treatment necessary. Important to be thorough. 👍","[[{'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.5147179961204529}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.46983441710472107}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.19714252650737762}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.09826569259166718}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.07952253520488739}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.0707903653383255}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.04453684762120247}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.03315049037337303}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.027192525565624237}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.02661227248609066}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.019197916612029076}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.01597537286579609}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.012769762426614761}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.012365427799522877}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.011776982806622982}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.0115432757884264}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.010770922526717186}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.0071075549349188805}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.006208602339029312}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.005668040364980698}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.0039692167192697525}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.003094244049862027}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.0029232841916382313}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.002412924775853753}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0021638760808855295}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.001556982984766364}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.0013327364576980472}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.0010392902186140418}]]"

"Better alone.. Honestly over the past few years I've realized that im myself when I'm isolated and closed off from the outside world, but as soon as I step outside I lose all identity.

For example, I'll be thinking over the errands I'll need to do outside of my house but as soon as im outside its like my brain completely resets and is being taken over, which leads to me staying home and anxiety arising.

Now about the being alone part, I don't have any friends and its not that I don't want them its that I can't have them, because I end up losing myself in them or behaving erratically without remembering or explaining myself, and in conclusion people just suddenly drift away.

Its come hard to get to know people or talking about my past because its all just bad and with minimal good things, I just dont want anyone to suffer because of me, because even if I explain myself as best as I can they'll still be confused and walk away.

Anyone can relate please leave you're thoughts, thanks !

"Not sure if this is the right place, but I am having a hard day. I have BPD and today and yesterday have been the hardest days in maybe a year. The problem is I can't tell if its the disorder or just my life. My marriage feels like it's falling apart. But is it me? The BPD? My husband? I don't know what to work on because I never know if it's an off week or if it's for real. But I haven't felt attracted to my husband in a long time. We have a daughter together and I wanted it to work but now I just don't care. But he is so in love with me which makes me feel so guilty. I WANT to care and I WANT the attraction back with him but it's like there's a block... if that makes sense :( I am so overwhelmed and really any kind of perspective will help. I feel like a terrible mom and a terrible wife today but I am trying so hard :( Ever feel like you just can't be happy?

"Currently dating a girl with BPD and I'm not sure I can take it anymore... I'm a guy that currently is in the dating game.  I've recently met this girl (24) that has BPD. Look - I have no issue with someone that has BPD. I've dated people with all kinds of issues and I would never be so bold to just purely judge someone because they have BPD. It's not the BPD that is the issue - it's how she handles the BPD and how she's treating me.  
I really like this girl - I really do and from what she has told me she is genuinely interested. She tells me that I'm cute, that she really wants to see me and that she should make me a priority. We've been dating for a week and we've had some decent times together.  However problems have started emerging. She recently went on this depressing episode where she doesn't want to do anything but isolate herself by staying at home, sulking all day and and doing nothing but watch Netflix and binge eat and feel sorry for herself.  I even had to cancel our dating plans because of this and when I ask her if we could reschedule I can't get a clear answer.  
When she gets on these depressive periods she is nearly impossible to talk to, much less reason with. All I hear from her is how the entire world hates her, how useless she is, how shit the world is and I'm getting the bad feeling that all I'm doing is being her therapist of whom she tosses all her problems to.  She says things like ""You'd better leave me, like all guys do"" and stuff like ""You'd better find another girl that isn't as chaotic and broken. All guys do"" etc. etc. etc. Not only does it sound manipulative and completely made up - it infuriates me when she says things like these.  
I can't get any clear answers from her. When will I see her again? Can we make plans on dating? How long am I going to have to wait? Can I \*DO* anything to help? Can we at least share a coffee and talk?  Everytime I ask her all I get is - she doesn't know.  
I do have patience, I am willing to put effort in to this girl and see how far we can take this - but I' not sure I can deal with the uncertainty. Telling me ""I don't know"" when I can see her is not good enough for me. I'm a guy that has needs, I want to be close to her, I want intimacy, I want warmth, I want someone I can share my day with - and this doesn't cut it.  
  
Please - I want you people to understand that it is not my intention to shame anyone that has BPD. People who have BPD has the equal right to find love and happiness as anyone else. i don't see someone who has BPD as inferior. I'm judging her on her own merits as an individual and how she is treating me. That is all that matters to me. If she is willing to put the effort in to making things work I couldn't care less that she has BPD. The problem is that when she gets depressed like this she pushes me away, and not only pushes me away - she can't give me a clear answer of when I can see her again.  All she says is how a horrible person she is, how her ex-BF is a piece of shit, that I'm going ot leave her like all other guys have in the past and I'm not sure I can take this anymore...  
She has BSD, she has told me so herself. She doesn't take her medications because she says it makes her feel sluggish and she doesn't go to a therapist either.  
I came off from a 9 year long relationship. The break up was very painful and I've been trying to coping with it. Meeting this new girl with BPD is not helping.  
I'm not asking to shame this girl. I want help and advice from people who are more experienced with BPD. I want advice because right now I'm not sure for how long I can keep doing this.","The expanded size of the tensor (891) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.

"Some tips for those on the road to recovery I suppose these might be a bit like 'duh', but anyway:

-Start tracking your moods like, yesterday. Either in a journal, or a blog, etc. Detail not only your moods, but what's happened during the day. This way you can read it back the day/week/month after and understand the correlations between your moods and the triggers, once you are no longer in that particular headspace. Eventually you will also start to identify triggers as they happen, and experience the resulting mood whilst being aware of what exactly is going on. Also, looking back on these logs whilst in a different headspace will allow you to properly identify when an emotional response was irrational/disproportionate. 


-Get a routine. I know you have heard this a thousand times, but it's absolutely ridiculous how much of a difference this makes. Make it as strict as possible without suffocating yourself. It will help you balance out your moods.


-On that note: Once you are at a stage in your recovery where you have been taken off meds and you are officially categorised as recovered (whatever that means tbh), break the routine. Start training yourself to be able to function without keeping yourself under such tight control. You run the risk of becoming way too neurotic and using the routine as the focus of your obsessive tendencies. At first it might irritate you to no longer have the safety of a tight timetable: This is fine and normal. You will get used to it.


-Find healthy coping mechanisms. Oncoming wave of untamed anger? Run that b*tch out of your body in the forest. Anxiety wave? Clean the house. Listen to music for hours. Puzzles. Anything that's steady and repetitive and therefore hypnotic.


-Do not get into internet fights. Delete your social media for a while if you have to. Do not respond to the idiot with the idiot opinions. AVOID TUMBLR but this is true for everyone on Earth. You will obsess. You will work yoursef up. You will feed the anger and anxiety with these virtual battles.


-If you have an argument with someone, walk away. It doesn't matter how righteous you feel, how angry you are, how absolutely certain you are of the fact that you have been wronged. Walk away the moment it escalates. Use one of your healthy coping mechanisms to calm down. Every time your brain starts talking about the conflict or the person you are in conflict with, think NO very loudly or picture yourself physically removing the thought from your brain. Do not act on your anger. Whether it's justified anger is irrelevant.


-Repeat to yourself, daily, that your disorder is an explanation, not a justification. Chant it if you must. Even if rationally you already know that. This will help you stop and think before you act/speak, eventually.


-Talk to yourself continuously. Do introspection. You need to become your own best friend, and you need to get to know your inner life better than you know the palm of your hand, in order to take control over it.


-Always keep in mind that people do not wrong others for no reason. Their reasons might be pure selfishness or even that they enjoy it, but 99% of the time their reasons are nothing that nefarious. It is very difficult sometimes, when you are BPD, to be able to remember that other people have their own lives and feelings and values and reasons. Try to not lose sight of that. If you do, tell yourself that next time you will do better at it. When you feel wronged and you get that barrage of 'this person is literally Satan', that's okay. Ride that out by yourself, do not confront the person. When it's out of your system, have a conversation with yourself. Try to understand the person's motivations for what they did. Talk (and I do mean talk, not argue) with them about it. Ask them to walk you through their thought process, and listen. Imagine yourself as the person, so you might understand where they are coming from. 


-There will be times, even 40 years down the line, when you will mess up. You will overreact to something a partner does, or you will spend a week deep in delusion. This is okay. This doesn't mean you have lost, or relapsed. Do not give up completely because your symptoms act up. They will, because recovery does not involve your BPD suddenly disappearing. That will never happen. Recovery is about managing and taking control of it.


-Remember that medication is a necessary crutch; it is the temporary help that allows you to be stable enough to engage with the main tools for your recovery: Therapy and developing self-awareness.

"Is it okay to meet multiple therapists (when starting out) before choosing one to stick with? Do I tell them I'm doing that? This is a weird sticking point for my social anxiety, I'd appreciate if you all could be my internet parents and help me out. 

I'm on the hunt for a new therapist. I've narrowed down my list to 5 that I would like to work with. It's really hard to find available therapists in my area at this time of the year, so it'd be best for me to call them all at once. But that makes me super anxious. Could you answer some questions for me please?

1. Is this a rude/bad thing to do in any way? To meet more than one for an initial appointment.
2. Do I tell them that I am doing this and explain I may or may not stick with them? Like what do I say if they ask me if I want to reschedule but I am waiting on being able to compare with another therapist? 
3. When they ask what timeslots I have available should I include the one(s) where I may be seeing/trying out another therapist or not? (since I will only be choosing one to see in the end) If not should I clarify that?

"Hello, BPD, Bipolar and GAD Hello, I was diagnosed with this two years ago but I didn't want to hear it and ended the conversation anytime it was brought up. I had a social security hearing and in the documents it said that I was diagnosed with BPD three different times by three different doctors over the last two years.

So I guess I have it...

I am 32, wife, mother to my 5 year old son. I had to give up some of my custody of my daughters due to my mental health so I only have them 29% of the time.

I struggle to get through the day, I struggle with basic tasks and relationships. I'm an absolute mess. I'm on 5 meds which make me feel numb which is a fucking wonderful compliment to feeling empty. Ugh.

I have had mental health problems since preschool and bouts of severe depression started when I was 11. My family used ""tough love"" to fix me and my problems. So I was never validated or comforted or anything. I was told to grow up and stop being lazy, stop being sensitive, stop being mopey. I think that's why I developed BPD. Or at least one of the reasons.

I have a question. My BDP girlfriend dumped me. If you want to know the reason check this link [https://redd.it/7oxl3x].  I didn't chase her. Do BDPs want their partner to chase them when they dump them? What do you think goes through her head because I do not chase? I don't want her anymore since I feel like I deserve better. I am a very loving and caring person and I will never be in a relationship with someone who abuses me.

"Boredom in a romantic relationship How do you deal with boredom in a relationship? 

I have hobbies that exhilarate me and a job that I love. 

But for some reason, in a romantic relationship, I tend to get very bored. 

My honeymoon phases end fast  and it’s probably because I over simplify everything and try and see things for what they are... and that’s all great except that it makes me feel like the relationship I’m in isn’t totally necessary aside from the physical intimacy. 

I love the guy I’m with... just need some guidance or tips if anyone has some to share with me.

Thanks!

"FP not talking to me and I’m trying so hard not to split on her :( My FP is my BFF, we’ll call her E. We’ve been hella tight for about ten-ish months - talking/texting/snapping every day, smoking weed together occasionally, Saturday adventures, she even babysat my kid a couple times when I was in a jam and helped me get an incredibly shitty job doing catering with her. 

Over Christmas she broke her phone and I didn’t hear from her for like four days. I was worried about her so I FB messaged her fiancé to make sure she was ok. I was honestly so panicked that she was mad at me and I had to know what was up. Things were normal for a few weeks. 

Now it’s been about a week since I’ve heard from her. One text in the whole week. I’ve texted, snapped, called, tagged her in dank memes on FB, and gotten one text in response. 

I know she sees my snap stories but she doesn’t open or respond to personal snaps. 

I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to seem desperate and I’m sure there’s a perfectly logical explanation - her phone is broken again, she’s really busy, she needs a break, etc. but the feeling of rejection and abandonment is real and I’m trying so hard not to let it get to me. 

Any advice? I’m not sure there’s a DBT skill for this. Thanks for letting me rant.

"Photos with sig other as an emotional trigger? Is seeing a picture of yourself with your significant other a trigger for you? I dislike seeing myself in pictures in general, but when I’m in a picture with a boyfriend or significant other, it sometimes triggers panicky thoughts and splitting, centered around how I think we look together or how one of us looks. 

Eg. “He looks creepy in this picture, oh no am I dating someone who’s creepy again? Why did I think I was ready to be in a relationship, I only attract weirdos. Look at you going around and leading people on again you don’t deserve to be in a relationship, you shouldn’t be dating him. You’re just pretending to like him, you can’t love anyone you’re a tease with a black hole for a heart”

It also has a dissociative feel to it, like seeing us in a photo together makes the relationship “real”, kind of like being snapped out of a dream. This is happening with someone I’m currently seeing (and who I think I like), so all of this is really unsettling and I don’t know how to deal with it.

TLDR I am attracted to the guy I’m dating but seeing us in photos together triggers me to panic, and I don’t know if I should be listening to these feelings of panic as indicators of a bad relationship or if this is just some irrational emotional response to being close to someone/having a fear of commitment.","[[{'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.48525741696357727}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.4071408212184906}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.32100343704223633}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.12212196737527847}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.11513347178697586}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.10756061226129532}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.08046232908964157}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.054410625249147415}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.05239273980259895}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.03891933336853981}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.02555718459188938}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.02461811900138855}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.02021676115691662}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.01700812764465809}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.014984413050115108}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.012723498977720737}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.011813716031610966}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.008237756788730621}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.008054905571043491}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.005751740653067827}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.004494111053645611}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.003891089465469122}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.0034841690212488174}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.0033727074041962624}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.0032333910930901766}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.002941527171060443}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.0011718475725501776}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.0006400470156222582}]]"
"What medication do you take and what are the pros and cons? I am very likely a BDP. Never self-harmed but I abused drugs regularly, all kind of them. Now I am close to 40 and my use is kind of controlled. It is so clear to me that most of my drug use is just self-medication. My anger issues sometimes get out of control and I find it really difficult to behave correctly in social setting. I just end up flipping and once I flip it is really difficult to get back to a good state of mind. After that comes the feeling of shame that are so depresive and hopeless. I was wondering if there is any medication you can take to unblock yourself when you are in a very bad place and out of order. I haven't had proper depression for a while, my problems are more conductual than cognitive at the moment, though the conductual part has a impact in my cognition.
Even if I am more interested in occasional medication for unblocking (don't know if you understand what I mean...), just discuss your medications in general. I'd love to hear what you need to say good or bad about them.

"I just broke up with my partner, and he is suffering of BPD. It's also assumed that I suffer of BPD. Essentially title + some more explenation. Me and my partner were together in a relationship for almost a year, until in november he told me that he was unsatisfied with how angerful and annoying I've been. that was around the time where i was looking for another therapist because I've known of the issue, I found a therapist already in summer, yet they just put me on the waiting list until a new spot was free (wich im still on while im at my new therapist)

So, in december I had an operation and was essentially stuffed with meds so I can cope with the pain. My partner was reaching out to friends, and such, and while I thought that was a good sign, I noticed they actually were avoiding me permanently, and when I confronted them about it, they said they were feeling uncomfortable around me. I know It's sort of pathetic, but I begged them to wait until i was off meds and can look for a proper change, but they told me it was too late so we had a break. of course I felt really sad about it, yet I was looking forward to reunite. fastforward some days, and my partner said we should get back together, wich i was of course happy about, but i was still on my meds wich probably influenced my personality. in the end, they broke up with me completly, because iw as just so 'strange'. of course I was broken by it, yet neither of us knew about the side effects of my meds wich essentially makes one depressive and emotionally numb. as i told them that, they said it wasn't excusing my behaviour in december, wich.. i agree with partly, but I still felt hurt.

Of course in january things just escelated quickly: I ended up avoiding bringing up our relationship in order to let them heal a bit, but they wanted to completly avoid me, despite tellingme they want us to be friends. then I of course talked about it, wich just made them more aggressive, and in the end, they blocked me yesterday wich was really just painful. They told me I was selfish, and delusional, and that we may never even get back together, despite me wishing for it so badly and getting an actual chance to change and work on my issues.

and now im sitting here, thinking what to make out of all this. I know I had impulsive effects, like overly caring for my friends, and investing alot of money into not needed things, and just as I stopped those impulsive actions, I kinda just faded out of existence. worst of all though, it all happened in short periods where i just couldn't recover completly out of it. My new psychatrist assumes I may suffer of BPD, but I never showed such strong effects until like very lately.

While I'll put the assumption byside, I researched our old logs, and finally recalled they were suffering of BPD too, it wasn't too severe, yet they never wanted to talk about their mental illness wich was a shame. I feel like if I've prepared better for it this could've been all avoided. But as other BPD symptomes shows, is there a chance they may return to me, and not put me as a negative influence in their life? Because right now I am very afraid about their situation, and if they'll loose all the new contacts they've made over the past month, I won't be even able to help them at all, yet despite loving them.","The expanded size of the tensor (764) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.

"Little things going a long way Hi all, 

Diagnosed BPD a little while ago, had a really tumultuous time dealing with it all but recently hopped on the skincare band wagon. 

Bizarrely, taking the time to do a daily routine in the morning really is making me feel so much better. I know it's common sense that self-care would make you feel good, but doing 3-steps just sets me up so much better for the rest of my day. 

Does anybody else have any experiences with things like this? I used to think doing these small things would be faddy and not help me in the long term but I could not be more wrong.

"Diagnosed. I had been diagnosed previously by my therapist, and I was pretty confident I had BPD based on my own research and from what I've read in this sub (thanks to all of you who post and put your hearts out there because you don't know how many times you've touched me and probably countless others) but tonight the psychiatrist gave me his opinion. BPD and Bipolar 2. What is the acronym for Bipolar 2? Anyways. I'm overwhelmed with emotions. Relief. I think. I am going to start adding Lamotrigine to my routine. In the past I tried it without success. I'm hopeful it will work this time. Hold my hand? hug me? Something. I need some support I think. I feel like I am on a roller coaster. 

I do have some questions regarding dating. I am single. The dr mentioned to me that at some point I might enter a relationship again. He told me that most people are happier in relationships and that it's ok. At what point do you tell someone of your diagnosis? I think it's on my mind because I have a date coming up and I quite like the guy. So far. We've only been texting...but if it goes well...how many dates later is appropriate to tell him, and when is it misleading if I don't tell him? I mean...I am trying to sort it out myself.

"Dog died, my symptoms are returning Things have really amped up for me. I'm overwhelmed, grieving, and my symptoms are trying hard to sneak out.

My pug, Mabel, was a piece of my heart. She and I had such a bond that I don't know I'll ever be able to recreate. She died last week from liver shunt complications. I thought the vets could stabilize her long enough to book her for corrective surgery (which was 6 hours away and super expensive, and only had an 80% success rate). But Mabel must have been too tired and in too much pain to want to wait any longer. I know she loved me, that much I know and feel. But shit, guys... I'm so lost without her. Our house feels so quiet and empty. Our other pug is lonely and sad. I really feel like I've lost a part of my soul.

Meanwhile, husband and I had a pretty heavy couples' therapy session, talking about our future. I'm not totally hopeless about reconciling our differences about having kids, but it's hurting. A lot.

I don't have many friends around here. The ones I did have were out of town when Mabel died. I've been walking around the past week-ish in such a stupor. I don't like leaving our other pug home alone for long, so any outings I have are brief. 

So I've been trying to talk more with my newly-discovered half-siblings and bio-dad (for the interested, you'll have to hunt through my profile. It's an interesting story.). And here's where my BPD symptoms are starting to fuck with my mind. These relationships are all very new, and I've been very good at boundaries with them until now. I've started becoming paranoid, though, that I text them too much. They're all busy people, so I don't expect constant conversation, but shit, I still feel so alone and I'm panicking if I've pushed a couple of them too hard over the past week. I'm especially worried about the bio-dad. On one hand, I thought I was being good with boundaries. On the other hand, what if I haven't? Have I been harassing him too much? I don't think I could handle rejection from these guys on top of everything else. That would be the straw to break the camel's back.

I'm so, so sad. And isolated and lonely. My short-term memory has gone to mush. I can't keep focus on *anything*. I need company desperately, but the only person I've hung out with is a friend I basically take care of, so being with them was exhausting. And I keep randomly crying at shit that reminds me of Mabel. 

Oh, that's another thing- my husband *despises* tattoos. I'm going to get a tattoo of Mabel's paw print, and he knows he can't control what I do with my body. But I think there's a cultural stigma for him about tattoos, so getting it will upset him. I had a very tearful argument about it yesterday. Which I could have done without.

I'm just so tired of this shit. I need a hug.","The expanded size of the tensor (683) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.  Target sizes: [1, 683].  Tensor sizes: [1, 514]"
"What to talk about in therapy now that I'm single? My relationship with my ex crashed and burned. He cheated and turned out to be not the person I thought he was.

He was a huge trigger for me. Every week I showed up at therapy in crisis due to our relationship. I had no shortage of things to talk about, but I also used my ex as a crutch to avoid talking about myself. At one point my therapist said: ""I think I know more about [exes name] than I do about you"". He pointed out that I need to focus on myself instead of what my ex does to me.

Once the relationship ended I had a lot of anxiety about what to talk about in therapy. Now I didn't have my ex to talk about anymore. It was a combination of being afraid of having nothing to talk about, and being afraid to have to face myself.

I've been having a lot of anxiety about my sense of self lately. I have no idea who I am since I left my ex. He became my entire identity when I was with him. Now... I feel like I'm just nothing. Floating through everyday.

While this is something I will definitely talk about in therapy... I'm still really scared that I will run out of things to talk about quick. Without my ex around triggering me, I'm actually pretty ""stable"" lately, so to speak (no crisis' I mean) but rather a vague feeling of apathy and emptiness. I don't feel like this is enough to fill 1hr a week of therapy though. At the same time I know it's a bad idea to stop going.

My therapist has been on vacation for a month now but next week I go back. I'm really nervous.

"Shock to the system (Venting) I'll preface by saying my story isn't worse or more significant than anyone else's situation. I'm just in a deep dark place (Like many others here) and maybe writing it out will make me feel slightly better because I don't really have anyone I can talk to. BPD seems to be the best explanation for what I'm feeling.

The backstory in all of this is that I had some childhood abuse. It wasn't violent abuse, it took a different form. Parents were in shouting matches every night, typically my mother doing the shouting, even when I had friends over. My dad wasn't around a lot (Kind of don't blame him even though he had his own flaws). And, my mother suffers OCD, so she would constantly move our rooms around while I was at school, come home and find out my room was in a different part of the house now. She also threw my stuff away constantly. This drove me nuts.

My grades suffered. I managed to get my GED instead of dropping out. And, I lost the ability to use public restrooms before I was 20 due to social anxiety. That led to staying indoors and a vicious drinking problem.

Now, I'm 30. I don't really have many friends left because they either moved on or are too apathetic to hang out with because I'm trying to escape that. Never been in a relationship. The one good thing is I managed to land somewhat of a respectable job, but I'm worried about losing it because I'm getting obsessed with online communities that are local trying to find some circle of people that possess positive traits who will... I don't know, pull me in and be the influence I need to reform. I had a good few months of feeling optimistic about it, and now I'm sliding back into the drinking and other counterproductive problems.

Turning 30 was a jolt to the system, like hitting your midlife crisis early. Because, I know where the direction of the path I'm on leads, except I can see the end now.

Everyone else's struggle is just as important. I hope you can find peace one day. That's all I wanted to say.

"I will never get over my ex-girlfriend and I honestly don't even want to. Having a really hard time lately, more so than usual. Therapy has gotten tough lately, because I've gotten to the point where my therapist wants me to let go of any hope that I have that my ex will come back to me at some point. My therapist is great, I love her and I couldn't ask for a better one, but on this point she doesn't understand that letting go of my ex is something that I just can't *decide* to do.

The only time in my life that I've been happy was when I was together with my ex, and her leaving me has pretty much destroyed my life for the last 3 and a half years. I know for certain that nobody else can ever replace what she was to me. I have reached the point where I'm not even attracted to other women anymore, it just isn't there. I have no idea how I'm supposed to just move on from that.

I've gotten to the point where I'm feeling desperate. I just want to believe at some point she'll remember me and care about me again, but its getting harder to convince myself that's true, and if she's gone forever, then I will never stop being miserable.

I don't know what to do. I wish I could talk to my ex somehow and make everything okay again, but I'm also terrified to talk to her because I'm afraid what she'd say to me. I feel like I'm running out of options completely.

Somebody please help.","[[{'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.33943793177604675}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.22274720668792725}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.19305488467216492}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.14939892292022705}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.10051428526639938}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.048931531608104706}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.03474905714392662}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.027854932472109795}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.02608918957412243}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.025736110284924507}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.024829406291246414}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.02394399605691433}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.023198934271931648}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.017487242817878723}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.013134256936609745}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.011833922937512398}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.009298844262957573}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.00829055905342102}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.007281232625246048}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.007008661981672049}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.006692508235573769}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.006523809861391783}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.00579360406845808}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.004485057666897774}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.0036604602355509996}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.0022909585386514664}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.0018406397430226207}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.0010446087690070271}]]"
"I think I convinced myself I loved someone. Am I really just using them? Sooo last year I got out of a really horrible relationship but it was the first relationship in which I actually felt like I loved the person. Afterwards I decided to ""rebound"" with this guy who's just the sweetest person. I wanted to get to know him because I wanted to know what it was like to be treated right for once and that's all he did. He was so sweet and kind and amazing. But I couldn't get myself to feel the level of love I felt for the other guy for this one. And why? But anyway I thought that those feelings would grow with times so after a couple of months we started dating and now is been 4 months and we've said I love you and all of that and I'm starting to think I never really loved him in the first place. Here's the thing though he's so so so suicidal and every time I've even mentioned breaking up with him he says something that hints he's going to kill him self if I do. I'm scared to break up with him because one, he's my best friend and I don't want to lose him and two because I don't know what I'd do if I did lose him. My life would be so fucking lonely. I'd have no one. But god, I can't go on pretending. Help...please.

Feeling overwhelmed over therapy I just started seeing a new therapist at the start of the month and have only seen her twice. I start school again on Tuesday and all of my classes overlap with her available times until the start of Feb. I really need the help and support especially with school starting and immediately after hanging up with the receptionist I started bawling. I feel really frantic and stressed about this ahhh!! I emailed her already to see if there were alternatives but I'm not very hopeful... I also feel like I haven't been conveying how much I'm actually struggling in our therapy sessions and if they're only once a month or so idk how I can get comfortable enough to share that stuff with her and get better!!! My past therapists haven't helped me much and this one seems like she really could help me grow and learn.

"Fuck DBT So I spent about 8 months in DBT because I wanted to give it a chance, but after going through the full treatment plan and also reading Marsha Linehan’s work firsthand, I can confidently say that it is not for me. 

Most of all, I hate group therapy. I don’t sympathize with or respect the other group members, and I feel perpetually unsatisfied with the answers the group leaders give me. It feels dismissive that I’m unable to talk about triggering behaviors like self-harm, eating disorders, and substance abuse, because these are important aspects of my life I need specific coaching on. 

I feel like the dialectical model is not only not useful for  working through schemas formed as a result of trauma, but can be actively harmful. Should you radically accept that you can’t completely trust anyone after being assaulted by someone you love? Or try and search for the validity in the perspective of a stranger who raped you? The interpersonal effectiveness models don’t function well for abusive relationships where the BPD sufferer is not the aggressor, and in my experience destabilize the confidence pwBPD have in their perception of reality and reduce their ability to trust their emotions. 

DBT also acts at a surface level to manage symptoms without addressing deeper foundations for patterns of behavior, and does not adequately justify its own axioms on a theoretical level. 

I wouldn’t dissuade people from trying it because it does help some people, but I’m tired of it being referred to as some cure-all for BPD. There are problems with it, and I think it’s important to have a space to discuss it critically.","[[{'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.5173203349113464}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.38203564286231995}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.1570415198802948}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.12496436387300491}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.07876550406217575}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.03847334533929825}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.03780924528837204}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.03488334268331528}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.018702028319239616}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.011910643428564072}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.011123182252049446}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.009974619373679161}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.006643481552600861}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.005282834637910128}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.00396511098369956}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.003747454844415188}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.003062281059101224}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.0023546628654003143}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.002171973465010524}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.001567291677929461}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.0015403053257614374}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0015086060157045722}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.001173716620542109}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.0010498586343601346}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.0009205999667756259}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.0008649489609524608}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.0007381875184364617}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.0003857003466691822}]]"
"Feeling crushed and worthless after session w/ psychiatrist My diagnoses of bpd was fairly recent but being diagnosed has made a world of difference in my treatment. I finally understand where certain behaviors of mine come from and I'm currently in dbt to specifically treat my bpd and am prescribed a mood stabilizer. However yesterday, things took a weird turn with my psych. I has just been discharged from the ward after three days following my suicide attempt. As we were discussing what had happened, she interrupted me to tell me that what I did was very attention seeking and I need to control my impulses. She then preceded to tell me that having bpd isn't something I should publicize and it's not something I should be proud of. I just nodded my head and said I understood. When the session ended I sobbed all night and just felt empty. I've heard the horror stories of psychiatrists refusing to treat patients with bpd and the stigma around bpd in the mental health world but I never thought my psychiatrist who I trust and can easily talk to about heavy problems would ever make ME feel ashamed for having an illness. Because I cannot stress how ashamed , embarrassed, and horrible I feel now. My suicide attempt was invalidated which hurt deeply because it definitely had nothing to do with my bad impulse control and I wholeheartedly wanted to die. Also, I have never ""publicized"" to anyone that I have bpd but I definelty never will now... my heart hurts for everyone who suffers from bpd.

"Overcoming fear/discomfort? Hi I hope everyone is having a good day!

So quick backstory: I’m pretty good friends with my boss but we definitely keep the professional line so like besides joking together at work and occasionally venting, she’s good at making sure there’s no enmeshment. 

The other day, I come into work to get a drink and she’s ringing me up. In front of two of my co-workers and my sister, she snaps at me over something. Basically, I didn’t bring my cup in for a refill but I had worked earlier that day so she knew I was here. I know it’s technically not allowed, but I’ve done it and no one seems to care that much. 

Anyways, I play it off and I manage to leave the store without any big scene. But inside I’m freaking out and I feel like crying and what not. She later texts me to apologize and I accept it, cause she was having a bad day.

Today at work, she apologized again and mentioned that she shouldn’t have said that in front of my coworkers but I can’t help but feel constantly afraid or on edge. Growing up, I was yelled at a lot and berated by my parents. Work was my safe place. But now I don’t feel comfortable. I feel bad because she did apologize and I know I’m overreacting.

How do you guys restore safe places for yourself after something like this?","[[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.3399113416671753}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.19426441192626953}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.1388188600540161}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.12901218235492706}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.08508523553609848}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.06669121980667114}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.05921710655093193}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.05490751937031746}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.0517418198287487}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.04874870553612709}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.037911709398031235}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.027352362871170044}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.023070771247148514}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.021339818835258484}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.01736854948103428}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.01165397185832262}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.011175332590937614}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.007160930894315243}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.006724281702190638}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.006560089997947216}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.004536099266260862}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.004480346571654081}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.003930899314582348}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.002448692452162504}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0023115933872759342}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.0016167237190529704}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.001602844917215407}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.00045040249824523926}]]"

"DAE have an irrational fear that something terrible has happened to your SO/they were in some sort of accident? I'm not sure if this could be attributed to BPD under fear of abandonment, or if it is something completely unrelated. 

It's not the sort of fear where you think they don't like you anymore or that they're going to like someone else more/leave you. It's different. It usually happens when I get deeper into a relationship and become more emotionally attached to someone. 

But basically, here's an example. This is how I was in my last serious relationship. 
So, say I haven't spoken to them for like 12 hours and I can't see any evidence of them having been on social media. 
I'll become overwhelmed with extreme panic that they were in some sort of terrible accident or that something awful has happened to them and I'll never see them again. To the point where I would get sick to my stomach and not eat and not be able to sleep. I wouldn't be able to concentrate and overall was just a complete mess. I would be beside myself and the only thing that calmed me down was hearing from them or seeing them active online. I try to keep it to myself cos I don't want to come across as really annoying but sometimes I would send a few random texts just trying to get a response so I knew they were okay. 
I would literally convince myself with every passing minute that they had died and were never coming back and that I would never see them again or hear their voice. And I'd think about how wonderful they are and how much they had to offer the world and all that cheesy shit. I'd get myself so worked up and so upset sometimes that I would be hysterically crying and hyperventilating. Just having a total panic attack y'know. Heart racing, shaking, the works. 

And then when they got back in contact it was like everything was right again in the world and I calmed down completely and was usually so relieved that I cried with happiness. 

I know that it's completely irrational and unhealthy. I hate it, it's like torture. And I try so hard to distract myself and stay busy and switch off my phone so I can't check it a lot and worry. I was lucky in that my last SO was super understanding and he knew I worried a lot so he always made an effort to check in and tell me how he was going so I wouldn't worry. 
But I know that it's unrealistic to expect everyone to be like that and I don't. I also know that I can't be carrying on like this every time I don't speak to the person for a while, it's just ridiculous. 

So I guess I'm wondering, can anyone else relate to this? Is it a BPD thing? And if so, how do you handle it? ","The expanded size of the tensor (601) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.  Target sizes: [1, 601].  Tensor sizes: [1, 514]"

"I'm so terrible to my boyfriend. I need to change. So I'm sitting on my bed in the dark after having the worst fight with my boyfriend. We have been fighting for weeks. Months really. Ever since our daughter was born 5 months ago. They're getting so bad. I'm so ashamed at how bad they are.

"DAE have issues staying at a job long term So, a little background....I have been diagnosed back in 2012 but haven't seen a therapist since 2013 (used online self therapy due to lack of time and cash).

I feel like I'm aware of my triggers and able to see when things are going south and I need to regroup.  The only thing I have issues with currently is employment. 

I'm a server with a hospitality degree with great experience.  Everyone enjoys working with me. I work hard and take pride in what I do.   I always keep bad attitudes to myself But for some reason,  between the 6th and 8th month into a job....I just can't stand it.  I don't know if it's bc I'm passive aggressive and start to implode from keeping everything in. I don't know why suddenly everything and person annoys me. One thing will happen and everything becomes black and white to me: I need to quit.

I know the grass is never greener on the other side. And even though I leave on good terms, usually, can't understand why I can't keep a job longer than 8 months before giving up on it.  There have been 3 companies that I have stayed long term with (one for 1 year,  another for 2 years,  and the last one for 5 years) so I know I can deal with bs.

But.... just need help with controlling the impulse to leave a good job just bc of one bad situation.   I just put on a month notice for a place and I'm already kicking myself over how much of an emotional idiot I am.   

Obviously,  this is something that I need to reconnect with my therapist about. But was wondering how others deal with job jumping. And if anyone has any coping skills that have helped them stay consistently at a job longer.","[[{'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.40435925126075745}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.26502397656440735}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.20876145362854004}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.07629621028900146}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.07232566177845001}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.06868384778499603}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.050004713237285614}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.043375469744205475}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.032846543937921524}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.032711707055568695}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.02824827842414379}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.02083461545407772}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.019698109477758408}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.017984045669436455}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.01663317158818245}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.015557662583887577}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.011514747515320778}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.008365566842257977}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.00792787317186594}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.007161445450037718}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.00658187223598361}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.0058538164012134075}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.004471911117434502}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.003985448740422726}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.0038292170502245426}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.0037530611734837294}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.0014242938486859202}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.0013489568373188376}]]"
"What I am inside     I feel the urge to walk. Sometimes I go out and head towards any direction, out of this need. I cried in the shower, I screamed in the shower, I danced in the shower, I punched my wall in the shower and I laughed in the shower.     

    I also wear  masks, thick ones, and I never know what mask I'm currently wearing. I have thoughts of homicide and violence.
            
    I find myself staring into the dark and the skies often, thinking of nothing. I feel empathy and lack there of. I am capable of hugging someone and imagining what their blood would look like on the floor next.

    I don't feel fear as much and I don't feel shame or guilt of things that don't affect me. I don't like getting into conversations because they bore me quickly.  

    I think highly of me, as some kind of protagonist. Someone special, more special than anybody else.   

    I think of walking out of this everyday, but curiously, I like it.

"Help With Grieving The Death of a Loved One New here! My fiancé was diagnosed with BPD when she very young, about 10 years ago.

Last year her best friend passed away at 25 years old. The two had a falling out a few months before he passed and never got a chance to resolve thing before he passed, so on top of the grief she’s feeling guilt as well. 

The anniversary of his death is approaching in a few weeks and she is having a very hard time with it. An anyone suggest the best ways for someone with BPD to deal with this type of loss? (She doesn’t currently have insurance so she isn’t able to see a therapist)

"Non-BPD trying to connect the dots My BPD ex got married to her partner. She was cheating on him the entire time while we were in love. However in few months, she decides to get married and over very minor issue she discarded me. It hurt me so much that I went down in deep depression. I tried connecting with her several times but she wouldn't talk and only push me away saying mean things to me.

 We work in the same office and I used to see her everyday. Slowly I started detaching myself, did some self therapy and went NC with the ex BPD. Once I went NC, I realized she was being playful and trying to get back my attention towards her. She'd make suggestive comments while passing me or sometimes would give me weird long stares just to get my attention. 

I was so hurt from her abandoned and absolute non-closure that I started to look for a new job. Once I got the job, I let her know. She was silent the entire time, although she came to the office the next day completely changed. She dyed her hair red and dressed up in a fashion that she never does or did. 

What could be the reason why she was doing push and pull? Why did she dye her hair and trying to change herself after knowing that I was leaving? Do you think I was ever important to her to hurt her at all?

PS. She's been already married when she dyed her hair. She invited the entire office to her wedding including the people she knew for less than 6-months. Super odd.

"How do I cope with my boyfriend not wanting to talk to me? I am 21F and my boyfriend is 22. I’m not diagnosed, but I had my first therapy session last week, and will continue going. So, I can’t say for sure what I do or don’t have, but I resonate a lot with many BPD traits. 

My boyfriend is incredibly sweet and is known as helpful by everyone. He really does help anyone anytime they ask for it. I’ve managed to make him lose feelings for me with my inability to manage any of my emotions and by projecting everything I feel onto him. When I made a therapy appointment, things got better for a while, and I WAS genuinely managing my emotions a lot better, but I guess I just burnt out and now I feel like I’m back to square one. It’s frustrating because when I am happy or managing my emotions well, we have an amazing time and are so close and happy. 

Understandably, my boyfriend is very frustrated and done with me. He says he isn’t leaving but I can see the toll I’m taking on him, and I feel like he doesn’t really want to be here, and is just staying out of obligation. 

It all boiled over last night after a night of drinking. He walked me home and dropped me off, but I felt like I wanted him to stay. He still had people in his apartment, and needed to get back. I know this isn’t a rejection of me and I knew it at the time. But I just FELT rejected, the emotion was overwhelming, and it was like I couldn’t manage the disconnect in my head. I started crying, he left, and long story short I called him like 45 times. 

I sent a bunch of texts begging him to just tell me he loves me and isn’t leaving. Of course he didn’t because I was being insane. I even tried to say I fell down and didn’t feel good because I thought if he was worried he would call. The more calls he rejected, the more panicked I got. I eventually did give up, but I felt horrible and abandoned the whole rest of the night. 

Logically, he should NOT have to answer those calls. I understand it’s unreasonable. But at the time I was just kind of in a breakdown. He wants to understand, and I’ve recommended some reading on BPD to help him understand, but to be honest he doesn’t seem interested in reading on it. Probably because he’s so done. I also still feel hurt because I’ve told him how hard I panic when I’m ignored, but he does anyway. I can’t seem to connect logic and emotion. 

Can someone help me out here? I am completely new to this and need some coping mechanisms or something. What can I do or ask my boyfriend to do to help stop this from happening? I love my boyfriend to pieces, and I really really want to make this relationship work. Most importantly, I want to stop taking such a toll on him and start being the partner he deserves.

"Does anyone else use sex as a way to keep a guy around/feel loved? (Also my personal situation) So I never used to be like this, but I semi-recently got out of a long-term relationship. And I am using Tinder and just meeting with guys and they're cute and everything, but I am not into casual hook-ups, but I end up ""needing to drink"" and then I end up giving them head. In the moment, I feel ""happy"" and like I matter, but then afterwards, I feel empty and realize that I'm just trying to fill a void.


Yesterday was a wake-up call. I am seeing this one guy and he drove over an 1.5 hour to see me for the weekend, so he was being really caring. Well, while he was here, I went down on him and then immediately felt empty because I knew I wasn't ready for that but was trying to be what I thought he wanted. 


So I made a very stupid decision to start drinking multiple shots of vodka while he was just resting in bed because I felt such an emptiness inside. I got very drunk very quickly due to the rapid consumption (very stupid, I understand. Working on this problem.)... well I totally blacked out. Don't remember what happened, but anyway, the dude later texted/called me when I woke up and the storyline goes something like this:

--Started crying/sobbing saying that I was going to kill myself :(
(Not suicidal in real-life)

--Hitting my head against things

--He kept trying to hold me down because I was running around and hurting myself and knocking over stuff

--He was going to call someone ? but I begged him not to because ""it would ruin my career""

--He told me to go to bed or he would leave, but I wouldn't stay in bed

--Apparently, he went to leave (and this is so shameful and embarrassing)... I blocked the door and apparently told him ""I would do whatever he wanted if he wouldn't leave me"" and then I took off his pants and started blowing him. Apparently this made him stick around...I'm not exactly sure of the timeline, but I did this again later according to him. He said I was going wild (TMI: but I was sucking so much, his legs went numb? so I clearly was very very bent on getting him to stay). 

--Well somehow he finally did leave (I'm guessing I fell asleep finally? I'll have to get more details) and he drove 3 hours home because there was bad weather :(


..........SO basically I was a complete and utter mess BUT he told me he still likes me and wants to see me again. He said he would come back today after he gets more sleep. Insane honestly... this should have been the biggest red flag. I assumed he would rightfully never want to see me again.

So how do I proceed... please, any advice? I really do like the dude, but I start to become a ""different"" person when I want someone to like me and then I feel bad and empty for being someone I'm not so I start becoming a mess.

"Seeking support I'm sitting here after another night of not getting enough sleep hating myself for everything I've done over the last 3 weeks. I picked up a pack of cigarettes yesterday even though I quit 2 years ago. I started cutting myself again after 8 years. I cheated on my husband with one of his coworkers and after he found out told him I'd stop talking to the guy and I'm still talking to him just deleting the messages now. I will say my husband has been amazing about this, he keeps trying to blame the other guy saying I have a mental health condition and don't understand there are lines that shouldn't be crossed. I can't help that I'm an incorrigible flirt and he took it to far. 

Don't get me wrong he doesn't trust me anymore. He comes home from work and checks my messages, he wants to rearrange the living room so the couch is next to his computer and he can see what I'm doing on my phone. If I want to go to the gym with a friend she needs to text him to confirm I'm really with her. I'm sure he'd also ask for a text when we're leaving so he knows when I should be home.

I know I deserve all this, really he should be leaving me but he's not, which i think is making me feel worse. 

I start therapy again on wed but right now I just feel like I'm imploding.

"Stopped therapy, please be kind Back in September I decided to go back to DBT therapy after a particularly rough breakup. (I had done and completed DBT a few years earlier but I felt my mental health was just spiraling out of control, along with my ex dumping me my parents went through a nasty divorce and my mom began dating someone new...SO I really needed some extra help.)

Anyways, I was pretty excited to start and open to trying to be better and figured even though I knew a lot of the stuff already, it never hurts to go back. When I first started, there was an intern there that mainly taught the class (though I didn't know she wasn't permanent) and I just really loved her and the way she taught. She reminded me a bit of myself, goofy, loud, eccentric, and as I've often thought of becoming a therapist one day, I really looked up to her and admired her.

Several weeks in she expressed one day how her time was almost up and me and and everyone else in the group was pretty bummed, but I obviously still planned on going. It wasn't my intention to not go anymore once she left. However, the other teacher that took over just started to drive me crazy. I felt like she wasn't challenging me enough, and she always seemed confused about what she was teaching and like she didn't even understand it herself! She never collects our diary cards so I stopped doing them, and she doesn't really listen to you when you talk, it's all very generic. She is a very nice person, don't get me wrong, but the feeling I get from her is that she doesn't have a lot of confidence in herself to teach and it kind of shows through in how she teaches and everything else she does. 

On top of that, my individual therapist was also very nice. But that's about it. I didn't feel like I was challenged a whole lot by her, and I always found myself wanting a little bit more. I have had a lot of therapists over the years and I find I respond well with ""tough love"". I don't always need someone just being extra nice to me and telling me ""it's okay."" 

So, after a few weeks of thinking on it, and a few missed sessions because I got a pretty nasty case of pneumonia that made me fall behind in the group anyways, I decided I didn't want to go anymore.

I would like to pick up therapy again somewhere else though. My insurance is supposed to start February first, so after that I was thinking of finding a new place. But I can't tell if I'm just making excuses for myself or not. I feel kind of guilty for not going anymore and sad. But I also feel I wasn't retaining much, and for the money I was spending without having health insurance right now, I'd much rather spend it somewhere else where I'm 100% satisfied. Right? 

I can't tell if I'm regretting this decision or not entirely, but I could use some insight, (kindly), please. Is there anything wrong with seeking therapy somewhere else? I really feel like I did give it a good go seeing as its already January. (Again, can't tell if I'm just making excuses to make myself feel better or not) 😩 hmph.

"I tried to burn down part of my social life during a breakdown, attempted to backpedal, but then it actually burned down anyway. I was in a discord with a bunch of people I still consider my friends. The other day I had a particularly bad spat with my roommate over something entirely petty (literally a single chicken tender), and to create some hard distance from them (in my head, at least), I spontaneously left the discord, and the FF14 raid group I shared with them. This obviously was a horrible fucking idea, and I quickly backpedaled. Things seemed fine, I had calmed down, made it to sleep, woke up, and was pretty productive in the morning.

Then the afternoon came. My roommate was told to ask what kind of mood I was in by my (former) raid leader, who wanted to talk to me, which I initially shrugged off as legitimate concern, until I poked him to figure out what he wanted to talk about. The short of it is, he exercised his responsibility as a Raid Leader to keep the morale of the Raid Team at a reasonable level. What this meant in practice was, with this having been the third or fourth breakdown I've had that has affected the raid or raid morale in some respect, was that he issued me a final warning.

At first I was shocked, but understanding. Then I pressed a little bit and asked him what he really thought was best for the raid group. He wanted me out of it entirely. At this point, I started dissociating like mad, my emotions were basically locked up in a case with 27 padlocks and 42 deadbolts. I really didn't say much more, and eventually said I didn't even feel comfortable holding my position while they find a replacement for me. My shame for wronging these friends is too great, and I can't even return to the discord, which has tons of non-raiding friends of the raid group, as well as some who don't even play the game. I feel like I'm a danger to humanity, and that interaction with me is like some sort of disease. It's like I spread negativity wherever I interact with people, and this isn't the first time shit like this has happened.

Do I try and work up the courage to face these people again? My BPD has erected a safety wall between my emotions and theirs, and I just don't feel I can believe them if they say they don't hate me. I could find new friendships, but my mistakes would just create a repeat of circumstances that have been repeating as long as I can remember. I can barely even trust the connections I have right now. I feel like everyone has me on their last chance. I don't even feel human anymore.

All of this literally could've been avoided if I didn't have impulse issues with food, and asked before I took an extra chicken tender.

"Friend said some really hurtful things, feeling awful A friend of mine has been avoiding me for months. I had tried to reach out to him on a handful of occasions to invite him to do things with me and my other friends, all of which he declined, claiming work and the holidays were crazy. I ran into him in public and he looked less than thrilled to see me.

In my gut, I knew something was wrong and his excuses were  B.S. I've been ghosted and dumped by friends before, and this felt too similar. After months of pestering and expressing my concern and anxiety, how much I missed him, he suggested we get coffee and I followed up with him a couple of weeks later to see if he was still interested. Having lost a lot sleep over his absence and behavior, I called him out a couple of days ago and asked for the third time what was wrong and if he was sincere in meeting up. 

He said a lot, but here's the gist: ""I DO like you and am 100% your friend, but...."" He told me our friendship was too intense and that he didn't like intense. He said that he felt friendship should be easy and it was work with me. Said he was upset when I told him ""things shouldn't change"" after he got a new boyfriend. He told me I was smothering him and reminded him (my words) of his toxic ex boyfriend, a man who he has confided to me many times that caused him significant grief and distress. Said ""I hang on too hard."" Said when we were out with his friends I dominated the conversation and pissed everyone off, that it felt like I was trying to  bring the conversation back to me and it was ""predatory friendship."" Felt ""belittled' at my frequent requests to hang out so insistently (which to me is crazy) But YES, he def. still wants to get coffee.

In the moment, I apologized profusely and tried to own up to any wrongdoing on my part, attempted to offer solutions, and asked him to be open and honest with me in the future on how he was feeling - he's a very passive person and is not very open with his feelings. However, I know I've done this to avoid being abandoned, and guys, I'm tired for apologizing for who I am all the time. I feel as the PwBPD that I am always over-compensating for my deficits and any problems in relationships are always on me, my fault, and the other person is innocent in the whole thing.

This friend and I, prior to his new relationship, I feel a had really great and in-sync connection and really enjoyed each others company. We hung out all the time. I like his bf, don't get me wrong. But maybe I am of no use now that he's around? Even though I agreed to meet up, I'm not sure I want to. It's exhausting trying to twist and mold and shrink myself down to fit someone elses ideal - I don't want to do that anymore. Granted, I""m not saying shitty behavior (although honestly, I think his perception is WAY skewked and projecting on me) is ok, or that ""Well I'm just going to be a garbage human and screw anyone who wants me to be nice!"" But....

It gutted me so what he said. I'm not sure I ever want to see him again. It cut me to the core. 

I'm not really the suicidal type of borderline, but I've been feeling really suicidal recently. I try so, so hard to be a good person and to strive towards healthy relationships. It's a lot of hard work, and I've worked my ass off over the years to be better person. Then hearing that, it feels like it's all for not. I am clingy, and demanding, but I""m also a really cool person too and has a lot of love to give, and hearing that was telling me he fundamentally doesn't like who I am, good and BAD. Our relationship is conditional on his rules - I've asked other friends about the situation, and they said I've come a long way in the last few years and they don't think I'm ""too much""

I'm almost 28, most of my friends are paired off and I keep thinking, ""Jesus Christ, between the dating fiascos with horrible men, failed relationships and friendships lost to life or BPD shit, is my life worth living knowing that I am going to end up alone? That despite my best efforts, its never enough?"" I'm very extroverted and it's easy for me to MAKE friends, but if this is the average outcome, is it worth even trying?

IDK, its so fucked up. I just ache everywhere and have been crying all night. There are two people inside of me, one who is this really outgoing, friendly,smart, funny, fun and passionate person who does great work in my community and strives to make the world a better place. Then, there's this emotionally volatile, clingy, selfish, irrational, obsessive, insecure, easily wounded animal who can't seem to keep people around and is constantly battling with herself. I wish I could be the part of me people love all the time. 

I know this was a long post, I just needed to get it out. If you made it this far, thank you for listening.","The expanded size of the tensor (1141) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.  Target sizes: [1, 1141].  Tensor sizes: [1, 514]"

"How to deal with friend that has BPD? So, I'm pretty sure my friend has BPD. He seems to be pretty stable for long periods of time, but then he starts to get obsessed with a girl and then becomes very unstable. He got a new girlfriend, so now we're apparently not friends. I want to be there for him as a friend when he's ready to talk to me again, but I'm just not sure how. 

He has been lashing out at me, calling me clingy and needy, and said I'm annoying and not funny. These things are clearly not true. In contrast, a couple months ago he told me I was his closest friend and wanted to hang out with me almost every day.

I'm positive he will come around again and want to be my friend in a few weeks or months. Probably when his girlfriend breaks up with him and he spirals into depression. She's cheating on him and telling people they're not even dating. Meanwhile he's planning out Valentines Day and telling everyone they're in love. So, It's gonna be a bumpy ride down. 

So how do I be there for him when he's ready? When he is stable, he is the best friend I've ever had, so I'm willing to forgive him for all the mean things he's said to me. I know none of this is his fault, and I do truly value him as a friend. I am concerned about him and feel bad that his girlfriend doesn't care about him and is cheating on him.","[[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.38509538769721985}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.23204253613948822}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.20297683775424957}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.12041453272104263}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.07943302392959595}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.07299485057592392}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.07173928618431091}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.05511628836393356}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.042853280901908875}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.04139252379536629}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.029724493622779846}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.02763931080698967}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.020154470577836037}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.016347670927643776}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.01627946086227894}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.015008966438472271}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.013596730306744576}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.011700307950377464}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.008530623279511929}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.004614760633558035}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.0030740282963961363}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.0022279962431639433}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.002214537700638175}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.00206819549202919}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0014184315223246813}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.0009642760851420462}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.0007443477516062558}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.0005009259330108762}]]"
"Told my friend about bpd and she completely disregarded it I was venting to my friend about it and showed her some posts from here that I considered relatable and she referred to it as ‘stupid’ and a made up illness. The thing that particularly annoys me about this is the fact that she’s constantly telling me that my reckless behaviour (living in the moment, disrespecting authority in school, being an extreme pleasure seeker, occasional extreme optimism and passion about life. Last year I got kicked out of school and sent to a pupil referral unit for a while) is abnormal and will only lead me to crashing and burning after school and yet she’s trying to tell me that i’m just trying too hard to be different with this disorder and that i’m just another normal human being even though I didn’t know this disorder existed until a week ago. I told her that she’s showing narrow mindedness in terms of the complexity and depth of human beings and that she’s projecting because she’s got a simple outlook on life. This type of thing only contributes to my lack of identity. It’s like in the process of trying to figure out who I am and why I act the way that I do (which i’m constantly told is abnormal) i’m being told by people to stop trying to be different.

"What is the biggest Trigger in relationships? I have come to really realize that my biggest and single most trigger in my relationships happens the moment I get ignored.

Out of all the fights and emotions ive been able to change and work through any possible arguement... but, whenever I get ignored by my own partner my heart turns black.

I know its wrong but honestly speaking; when someone ignores me, it feels like they dont care about the relationship at all, and i eventually start acting careless and break up to treat them like they dont exist because i feel that its the equivalent to how i felt.

Does anyone else struggle with this?

"Question around Favourite Person My very recent ex of 5.5 years was clinically diagnosed BPD before we met, she told me this before we dated and I accepted it. For a long time we were happy, ups and downs as to be expected, but she managed the illness well. Shortly before Christmas she started talking to a guy who I believe replaced me as her favourite person, because we were having a hard time and he was a random on the internet who could tell her whatever he wanted without ever having to follow through. Would mention he is married with kids, but this didn’t matter. He also lived thousands of miles away.

I said she has to stop talking to this guy (after she admitted inappropriate messages) and she said she didn’t want to, so I ended it.

Since then I don’t believe she has split me, but I want to know if there’s any hope for the future. At the moment I am certain it done, but I wouldn’t rule out something in the future, I just want to know peoples opinions on this, was I unreasonable and what was the thought process behind abandoning a relationship with someone who had been there and supported her for a random guy she only just met?","[[{'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.6775363087654114}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.23396506905555725}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.16473452746868134}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.053773846477270126}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.029794741421937943}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.02942390739917755}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.02793845348060131}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.027308834716677666}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.014853269793093204}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.014755528420209885}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.011252887547016144}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.00878280308097601}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.008449440822005272}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.006230685859918594}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.0053745838813483715}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.005024143029004335}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.0047821118496358395}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.004426314029842615}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.003998357802629471}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.003964849282056093}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.001811936846934259}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.001434722333215177}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.00125523388851434}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.0012280050432309508}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.001146249589510262}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.0009651860455051064}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.0006305666756816208}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.00025662887492217124}]]"

"Tomorrow is the first day of my life No, I will not to be born tomorrow, I’ve actually been around almost 29 years on this planet bu this far. But from tomorrow I will be the person who is doing everything he can to survive of this bullshit illness.

Even though I’ve not been diagnosed yet I’m certain that I have BPD. Actually been already more than a year and before that suspected it for several years. I am quite a textbook example: extremely unstable emotional balance, reckless lifestyle and the terrible emptiness often correlated to intense dissosiation which is a combo that hasn’t given me a peace since I was something like 10 years old. In addition I consider myself to fulfill the other 5 characteristics as well.

I have fucked up almost all of my important relationships by this far. Especially the romantic relationships make me a complete unstable monster with all the basic features from splitting to fear of abandonment. I’ve been in two relationships and especially the destruction of the last one ended about a year ago makes me still feel worse than anything else. I really think that she is the love of  my life and that se also loves me a lot but I made everything to destroy us, even though I don’t think that I had much control over myself.

Actually a year ago, right after the breakup, I was in an exactly same situtation but managed to fuck everything up by thinking I’m ok right after one month when I was feeling much better. I mostly managed to do it by living by very strict routines and leaving all the destructive shit like binge drinking, porn, etc. out of my life. I thought that I finally found a cure to my illness and was finally capable to control it and cancelled a psychiatrist meeting. But it took no more than one month when I was back again in same pit and it has continued from there to this point and several more mistakes have been made.


Anyhow I just wanted to say by this post that now I have had enough. From this on I will do everything I can to fight against this. Meaning that I’m going to meet a psychriatrist and get myself to therapy, leave alcohol etc. totally atleast for few months, and make my daily routines as good as possible. And I will not quit until I’m either cured even it would mean to stay on this road the rest of my life.

I will higly appreciate any tips or recommendations for this road. 



P.S. This whole post was a total stream of thought I just wanted to put on a textual form. If you are interested I can open my background more in an another post or even write somekind of blog about the progression of my life. Actually I might do the second anyway – just to make it little easier to stay on the road I’ve now chosen.

I've had my first talk with a therapist, and she mentioned the homework you get, to better yourself and think about how you behave and feel as such. 
The problem is, I almost never have energy to do anything. I feel like I wont ever change, that I'll never get an education or kids, or anything. I feel so tired. And I'm so scared of being with other people, and I don't know when the group starts.

"Saw pictures of a crush I had on Facebook - feeling huge regret for not having done anything I had really low self-esteem problems up until 2017 and didn’t think I was attractive enough. This is despite her telling her friends she had a crush on me. She would come close by at every opportunity to talk but I couldn’t build the courage to go speak to her. 

She was so pretty and although she ultimately gave me the confidence to find myself attractive I went all BPD and fucked it up. TBH I think she had problems too.

"I'm at my wits end with life.. Any advice? Hi guys I need some help. The older I am getting the worse my BPD gets. I'm talking  to a therapist once a week for an hour each session. I feel like it's getting me no where. Where is Dr. Drew when you need him lol but anyway I feel like I'm annoying to be around and that I could drop dead and no one would give a crap. My bf is so patient and amazing to me but yet it's never good enough or enough for me. I still feel like him being with me is ruining his life. Because we get into arguments because of me. I get pissed about the smallest things. As in he doesn't respond the way that I need him to respond to calm my insecurities and my anxiety and so then I throw a fit and leave the room. It's not right of me to do that. Idk what I'm looking for. And I basically have pushed so many people out of my life that I have no one besides him and my parents. I have a lot of acquaintances but I don't want to be around them because I'm not comfortable being myself so it's exhausting pretending to be happy and that everything is okay. My job is extremely stressful and I dread going in every day. I work in IT as a system admin. I make a good amount of money to be independent. But to what avail? My job makes me want to shoot myself. I go to the gym and that's all I really have. Any hobbies I had are gone because I dont have any desire to do them because I'm so far gone depressed. They have me on welbutrin and it doesn't do anything for me. I just feel completely useless to the world and to the small amount of people in it. And I'm sick of living in my head. I'm self destructive, anxious, depressed, hate people, hate myself, think im ugly and fat, feel annoying, feel irritable, etc. I don't have the balls to follow through on a suicide but I feel like I have no other options. Idk how to get better. It's been 29 years. I've talked to so many therapists and people. I've read self help books articles. I tried to become super involved at church but that became too intense for me. All the happy people made me feel more shitty.  I have horrible anxiety attacks that leave me throwing up until 3 or 4 am and I have to call off work the next day or go in and die at my desk...So idk what to do anymore... Any thoughts??","The expanded size of the tensor (541) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.  Target sizes: [1, 541].  Tensor sizes: [1, 514]"
"Why do I keep thinking about people that hurted me I had a weird experience with my ex therapist. Basically I got obsessed with him but he wasn't good for me. He didn't see that I had bpd he kept giving me labels and discarded my point of view. I'm sure he was and is a sociopath (i spotted it by non verbal signs and his ways of behavior). He told me I was crazy and gaslighted me. Last session (like the 8 session I kept seeing him because he was my obsession) he wanted me to pay him and sign a contract and I said ""no because you treated me badly I want to end therapy but I want to know why you did the things you did"". At that point he said ""if u don't pay me we have finished here"" and ""you are crazy I'm going to call the hospital or the police if you don't leave my house I give you x minutes"". Then at one point he grabbed me by a wrist and made me go away. I sat there outside his house because he broke my heart. I wanted him to be honest and to tell me his intentions. But he approached me and said go away I'm going to call the police. I left and he said ""you know you are supposed to greet someone when you leave"". Wtf.

After 2 days I was put in a mental health hospital. I think this abandonment triggered me. For some reasons he knew I was recovered. In the hospital I texted him and he said ""think about your well being and you can contact me when you get dismissed"".

When I got dismissed I said to myself no more contact with him. I am lucky since he lives very far away so I don't see him. At first I was doing a good job forgetting him. But now I feel heart broken. I trusted him and had a strong transference. He is the one in fault here. He's a therapist but I think he has some issues also he's a sociopath. I want to pay him because I don't want to have this debt forever. Also these days I keep thinking about texting him. I fantasize about getting drunk and send him a text saying ""I want to die"" only because I can hear from him. I fantasize about being in a relationship with him.

He was abusive and I don't know why he got rid of me. He said that he wasn't able to handle his counter transference. But I want him to give me an explanation! He's a coward he's not giving me an explanation and he has 35 fuckin years old while I'm 23! I said to him he's immature. I want to wait until I get worse and then text him. I feel like I'm the crazy one here. Why do I keep thinking about him after his treatment? When I was in therapy I thought I loved him he filled my void. But it was more an idealization, an obsession.","The expanded size of the tensor (608) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.  Target sizes: [1, 608].

"I feel like everything is falling apart...again Last year I went through a lot. For the first time in my life I stepped into a relationship, knowing well I wasn't ready for it. The relationship was emotionally abusive to the point where my eating disorder came back into my life. I rapidly lost 10kg and spent my entire summer torturing myself with hunger and self harm. Things got worse in September-October. I was constantly splitting on everyone around me, I couldn't control anger outbursts. I attempted to jump off of a bridge and was stopped by the police on the look out. I was extremly dependent on the person who I was with and he used that against me, then just in a day I went completely numb. I felt nothing towards him so I broke up with him right away. It hurt his ego and he kept harassing, manipulating and trying to blackmail me. At the same time I went numb towards my best friend of 7 years as well. We went through several huge arguments before and I was really hurt. I felt lonely, really lonely. I came up with a plan to kill myself right after my 20th birthday. I got a diary. I started a countdown. I wrote down everything I wanted people to know after my death. 3 days before my birthday I backed away from my plan. I thought that it's not worth it after all. I still felt empty, really empty, but there were this moments when I felt alive. I thought I can give things a chance. That was less than a month ago. Now, all of a sudden I have this fear that this one person in my life will abandon me and this is the person I feel alive with. I hate how I can't take this. I feel like I'm going crazy, but I don't want to be clingy. Is this how my whole life is going to be? I can't even access therapy anymore.  I can't take this. I don't know what to do. I don't want to die, but sometimes I feel like I dont have a choice.","[[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.5235086679458618}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.2926386594772339}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.10766302049160004}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.1045546606183052}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.09618189930915833}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.03962348401546478}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.032647326588630676}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.022912951186299324}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.01954030804336071}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.017400449141860008}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.012390160001814365}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.011851032264530659}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.01124624628573656}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.01033691968768835}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.009995921514928341}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.007882943376898766}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.005694669671356678}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.005680258851498365}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.005518865305930376}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.005364494398236275}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.00524323433637619}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.0048346747644245625}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.0028355130925774574}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.002809861907735467}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.002146301791071892}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.002030402421951294}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.0008146720356307924}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.0006743427948094904}]]"
"Complete inability to accept yourself I have an incredibly powerful, invisible barriers against accepting myself.


My default mode of functioning is a constant berating and pessimistic narrative, in which I ridicule myself for awkwardness and stupidity, constantly find and obsess over physical imperfections and feel a deep resentment towards myself.


Most of all I have grudges against my physique. Right off the bat, I could recite you at least 100 ugly things about my body. There is just so much. I refuse to accept and love myself. It's sort of detached perception where even if I rationally know that I look OK in certain clothes and makeup, I do not feel emotional connection/acceptance of my body, I feel like I was a soul trapped inside a mishapen, awkward manequin. I legitimately think I'm 1-2 out of ten on the scale of attractiveness and constantly dream about plastic surgery.


Part of this mindset is that I don't identify emotionally with my achievements and do not feel any joy and pride from them. I'm an aspiring academic and just last month I graduated my masters, got an article accepted for publishment, performed at a large conference and passed a hard state examination. None of this made me feel even remotely good about myself.


On the other hand, I completely identify emotionally with my misfortunes, which trigger fury with myself and punishing my body in a number of physical ways. I am literally covered in self-inflicted scars.


What should I do?

"My skill level at things like guitar varies depending on my state of mind and not only skill level, but my perception in a way. i get stuck in modes where im sortof seeing things note by note instead of the overall feel of the song. i think it has to do with detachment, but i wish i just had a consistent state of mind and feeling. maybe id get bored of feeling all the time? sometimes i think thats why i detach, out of fearing the realness but also feeling ill get bored of the same feelings.  yet when im not feeling, its like i forget how to feel.  and so when i try to do something i would feel emotionally, such as playing a song on guitar, i end up feeling almost nothing or actually, ironically, the same detached feel that i felt before--so by avoiding feeling the same things i end up feeling the same things, but not the non-detached same things, the detached same things.  i hope this makes sense and i dont sound silly or nonsensical.  sometimes i think im the only one that experiences these types of things, and maybe its not a bpd thing (and im not diagnosed so yeah, not searching for one dont worry, i just relate to like 90% of bpd symptoms full disclosure)","[[{'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.22722689807415009}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.17262190580368042}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.13471220433712006}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.12396877259016037}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.09982261806726456}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.049645841121673584}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.04731760546565056}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.043178219348192215}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.029320377856492996}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.028359726071357727}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.014439938589930534}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.010078447870910168}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.007552714552730322}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.006482505705207586}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.0062767514027655125}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.00439626257866621}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.0031597279012203217}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.003052659332752228}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.0029318276792764664}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.002481769071891904}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.002216231543570757}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.0021977098658680916}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.0016553094610571861}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.0016301397699862719}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.00159470085054636}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.0011679810704663396}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.0006918259314261377}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.0005859351949766278}]]"

"Dilemma /: Two years ago I fell in love with a guy for the first time. I was head over heels for him. One day he ghosted me. I found out months later he actually had a girlfriend the whole time. No one knew about his girlfriend. Not even his friends, his friends actually thought him and I were together. He said he was depressed all the time. The whole time He told me he had depression and anxiety but I think maybe it was a lie for me to feel bad for him.. he gaslighted me and told people I’m crazy. He just really stabbed me in the back and broke my heart. It still hurts to this day. I still think about it every day. Well it’s been two years since we have talked, and one day he tells me he is sorry. And now he tries to chat with me. If he ever wants to be romantically involved again, I know it would be horrible, especially with my BPD, but I don’t know if I can resist it because I loved him so much...

"Addiction and relying on relationships and other self-destructive behaviors for purpose when there is none As I’m sure many of you here on r/bpd already know, romantic relationships are VERY difficult. I find it overwhelming how obsessive and reliant I am on someone for my own happiness when I am in a relationship. When I’m with someone, every moment and emotion is influenced by where my SO and I stand and how we interact. I feel as though I have no independence or self because my life exists just for that one person and every feeling has to do with them. Since I was dumped a few weeks ago, I have turned to obsessive behaviors such as masturbation (way too often.... waaaay too often...), cutting and ED behaviors and it never feels like enough. I think it just clicked in me that if I were to ever have some sort of relationship in the future it would set me back.... it’s just like the other things I have gotten addicted to. It’s weird because I can be deep into one or many self destructive behaviors but when that’s done it’s done and I don’t have that problem for a while. I’ll do the shit out of something until I don’t do it at all anymore. I’m scared it’s the same with dating. 

I have had periods in my life where I wasn’t really addicted to anything or anyone and it was really great but it seems relationships are another form of addiction for me, and when the relationship isn’t going well is when I start rolling into obsessive patterns of harmful ineffective coping skills and behaviors. 

It just clicked that I really shouldn’t ever date unless I want to half the progress I have made and will make when I am single. Even when I’m doing well, I fuck up somehow. I got dumped because when I was drunk I called and told him how dating him has made me confused and feeling weird because I felt so happy and stable before the relationship.... i suck I know. I honestly don’t ever want to get this bad again... I had a taste of stability and happiness and passion for a few months when I was single and an unexpected fling has me feeling empty as fuck again. I am sick of being caught up in behaviors that make me feel this way. I just want to love myself and be happy again.

"No hopes of getting better. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm always filled with a mix of rage and anxiety that just gets progressively worse as the day goes one. My days meld together, I lock myself away from everyone and everything. I try to put on a happy face but inside I'm holding back screams. I've tried to convey to my SO what is going on but it seems as if she doesn't have the capability to fully grasp what exactly I'm dealing with. I hate the fact that my brain jumps to things like, ""if she really loved me she'd understand."" I men, cmon. How unrealistic is that?!

I kinda live on the middle of nowhere and finding a professional to treat me let alone for bpd would be almost impossible. That's before the worry of will my insurance cover it. I'm so tempted to get drunk and just flip out, so they're forced to hospitalize me. I've gone through many hospitals and inpatient centers and I've never gotten help. They're essentially babysitters that are there to make sure you don't kill yourself whilst never actually helping you with any problems. 

I have about a 10 inch scar on my forearm, I got that after an attempt a few years ago. Somehow I pulled through. After that I went to a facility. While there we had classes on things like strokes...never about coping mechanisms, never any therapy, never saw our doctors. You know it's bad when the ""crazies"" set up their own therapy session. But that's what we did. Man I've never seen so many grow men cry. We were there for each other when no one else was.

"Need advice on how to be less emotionally dependent on my FP I (22M) met this amazing person (18F) in college and we got really close very quickly, however, our relationship has always remained as friends even today.

"I don't want to loose my GF Again Hello Everyone i am in a relationship with my ex and we got back together after 5 years and its been six months we are dating. In the beginning everything was perfect and going smoothly then she told me about her BPD and I am totally okay with it and willing to support her.
She had some insecurities regarding our relationship like she think it would leave her again or her parents won't be agree for our marriage because of religious conflict. Everytime I had assured her that I won't leave her again and I always be with her no matter what happened but,
it's been a month I have observed that something has been changed in her like she has stopped expressing her emotions or feeling to me and we barely talked now or we only talk when she want to talk. she might be online but won't respond to my texts or calls and when I ask is everything Okay or is there anything she wants to talk about and she just told me she that everything is alright and i don't need worry about it.  
Whenever i express my love emotions to her she just told me that she is not in mood or simply changes the love topic between us.
I love her and don't want to loose her again. 
I know she is going through a lot want to help her and make her happy but I am bit frustrated right now I dont know how to deal with this
Please help me with advise or suggestions. 
Thanks again!

"Shattered Glass [poem] Shattered Glass

××××

Mirror, mirror, on the wall

Two figures stare; one tall, one small

A looming figure above my head

That's telling me I should be dead

××××

A stricken panic, I just can't cope

It holds me in its grasp, I weep 

This demon hangs me with theoretical rope

Inside my mind it rots me, deep

××××

Mirror, mirror, shattered glass

Sadness, lustre, happiness and hate

This mental state I cannot grasp

It's exhausting carting all this weight

××××

A kaleidoscopic mindset

A shattered, fragile mind

A carousel of feelings

The right one, I just can't find

××××

Mirror, mirror, I need your help

Give me insights, what is my identity?

"DAE lose their temper in public? This is the most embarrassing part of BPD for me. I lose it in grocery stores, at work, around family, anywhere. Today I lost it at Kroger and a woman laughed at me. She made it worse. These tantrums really are uncontrollable. Why would I choose to make a fool of myself? I'm more likely to lose my temper in public, too. Being around a lot of people stresses me out. I'm scared someone will record me some day, post it all over the internet. ""Crazy girl fights with her boyfriend.""

"Allowing yourself to live I'm fairly stable, only incredibly tiny little swings

But I'm questioning myself, ALL the time.  Are they really little swings, or is that just a part of life?  Am I starting to get manic, or am I actually interested and enthusiastic about something else?  Can I have a couple drinks over a few hours and not feel like I'm going to ruin my meds?  Is it normal to have all these questions, or am I just worried all the time that I'm slipping?

Like I said, I'm stable, my meds are all levelled out with no changes for years.  I'm in a stable relationship, stable family, etc etc.

"Why do people suffering from BPD tend to overshare personal information before they know they can trust the other person? I told my therapist that I’ve been in positions in the past where I’ve overshared very personal information with people who I’m just starting to become friends with or in the very early stages of dating (I.e first or second date). This can later give me anxiety or put me in a position where I’m scared to do anything what might annoy the other person (unintentionally) in case they tell my secrets. It can also be a case that I’ll have paranoid thoughts that I’ve already upset the other person if I perceive that they’re acting differently towards me. 

Me therapist has asked me to really think about why I do this. Why do I put myself in this position. I really have no idea why I do it so I’m wondering if other people who also do this, know why ?","[[{'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.4872150719165802}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.41920796036720276}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.31353893876075745}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.2974003851413727}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.0752769187092781}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.040753625333309174}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.03118719905614853}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.027610240504145622}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.027232792228460312}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.024746274575591087}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.024050574749708176}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.01700662076473236}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.015110844746232033}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.013715989887714386}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.010346484370529652}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.009695323184132576}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.0064990888349711895}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.006229989230632782}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.005940849427133799}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.005640480201691389}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.005613074637949467}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.005193367134779692}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.004969652742147446}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.0039802673272788525}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.003378403838723898}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.00303098326548934}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.0009396224049851298}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.0007638405659236014}]]"
"How to access wise mind Hey r/bpd,
Do any of you ever have trouble accessing your wise mind? 
I was thinking about some difficult stuff in my life and I guess it freaked me out. Now I feel like I'm locked out of my own mind, and the thing I need to open the door is on the inside... I forgot the key. It's like a labyrinth in my head. Do you ever get this? Any tricks to get back into myself? I don't think it was supposed to be difficult. I want to feel that I am doing the right thing and avoiding harmful behavior, but I don't feel like I can trust myself right now because I am not inside of myself. 

Maybe this is just a passing anxiety mindfuck attack but if you have any tricks to get back inside I'd love to hear it!

Thanks!

Edit: I was in panic and I didn't realize!

"I can’t stop thinking about my former therapist When I first got some actual therapy, before I was diagnosed, I was treated at the psych trauma unit and my talks were once a week. The person I talked to was a social services student and they do idk x amount of months work experience sort of thing as part of their education.

I’m 26 years old, he’s two years younger than me, so we’re very close to being the same age. He was pretty quiet and timid when we first met but as the weeks went on he clearly became more comfortable and capable. 

The thing is, our last session was about a year ago since I was moved to go to dbt and he continues studying, but I still think about him. I really really miss him and I feel like I’m in love with him. When our last session was over he asked if he could give me a hug and told me how intelligent snd wonderful he thought I was. Granted, I feel like I’m in love with quite a lot of people but this feeling toward him is SO strong. I often dream about him and I’ve seen him a couple of times since a year ago because we attend the same university, although he just graduated. 

I’m just so hopelessly in love with him and I can’t really keep this to myself! I have a partner of almost 6 years though that I love dearly and don’t want to and won’t leave. I know it’s the bpd making me feel tjos though but I feel like sharing this with my partner wouldn’t really be fair and doesn’t matter cause nothing would ever happen.

"I’m fed up of this I’m honestly at my wits end. I’m highly considering just throwing in the towel on my life &amp; being done with it. 
I feel like I can’t take another day with BPD. The mood swings, the black &amp; white thinking, the splitting. Everything. I feel like I’m going crazy &amp; I feel like I’m fucking drowning in all of this. 
I’ve been in therapy for 5 years now &amp; I’ve had a go at a few medications aswell, none of which have worked. 
I don’t know what else I’m supposed to do, this illness is affecting every single aspect of my life more than it ever has. 
I’m so angry all the time &amp; I just want to break up with my partner out of spite, because he’s ignoring me. Goes to show how irrational I am all the time haha 
I just don’t know where to turn anymore, I truely don’t. The thought of having another intense mood swing makes me so anxious, that it ends up me having a panic attack. 
It hurts, physically &amp; emotionally all the time.

"NHS Treatment with BPD Hey guys im just wondering who else is going though the NHS and trying to get help. 
For ages I had to ask my GP to refer me to counselling and after talking to them and being on a waiting list for half a year they discharged me to CMHT... all good... untill CMHT refused to see me and pushed me back to the counselling service. Some time later after a few times ending up in A&amp;E and the psychiatrist there refered me back to CMHT. 2 months later they then gave me the diagnosis of BPD and GAD. 
They said I would get DBT soon however over 6 months have past and I seen the psychiatrist again and he said that I might be too Emotionally Unstable to do DBT! 
Where do i stand what can i do? I thought the therphy was to help me with my emotions... i just dont understand why this is the case surely i need the help more than before and if im too bad now why didnt they give it me a over a year ago when i asked for it?! 
Am i doing something wrong? What do i need to do? Also everytime i seen my psychiatrist he refuses to change my meds as it will disrupted therphy with mood changes but the AD interacts with migraine tables so im having to suffer with painful migraines aswell. 
Any tips or tricks with dealing with NHS?

"It’s Coming Back Last year, I met my FP through an online game. We became so close and we became best friends. The longer we talked, the more attached I was, I was attached, the more toxic I got. He was able to tolerate and understand my situation, it got so bad that I used to open his Snapchat and check if he was talking crap about me (He let me borrow his game account for something else and I assumed he had the same password for everything.) I noticed that what I was doing was bad and told him to cut me off from his life (I confessed what I did), which he did. It took me a long time to move on, I had to remove myself online and stop using my phone for weeks so that I’d forget about him. Since then, I never let anyone get close to me. I was better, I get insecurities now and then but I was better.

Few months ago, I started going back into gaming, different name. It all went well, decided to talk to old friends and started catching up and now I found my FP, with a new crowd, as though I never existed and it’s all coming back.

Now I’m angry, bitter, and I feel even worse than ever. I feel like all the progress I made has just been destroyed and now, after I’ve spent weeks trying to focus on anything other than bpd, I’ve only gotten worse with my interpersonal skills and emotions. However, when I focus my energy and mind on recovery entirely I start making strides again. Is this normal? Should I keep going this way?

"My boyfriend wants me to stop acting like it's ""the end"" every fight or disagreement... help? Just a little backstory... like most people with bpd, I have a strong fear of abandonment, but not only that, it has truly happened to me over and over again, starting with my dad when I was just a little girl. Today my boyfriend and I got in a disagreement, and after things were resolved he requested that I stop assuming he wants to dump me/that this is the end every fight. He said its toxic and not good for us, and that just because we fight doesn't mean he wants to leave me/he's in it for the long run etc. all great things to hear but I still don't know how to let go of these fears? I know this is my bpd acting up big time and I'd just love to hear some coping mechanisms for this. Because honestly as it is, if he even gets a little mad at me, I assume he wants to dump me (not always voiced) and idk, I just assume my natural state of being is very unloveable and it sucks.

I'm seeing a psychologist tomorrow. I am not officially diagnosed with BPD, but I did quite an extensive research and I'm absolutely convinced that I have it. I'll know better tomorrow.

"Well, here it is. The end of my unstable relationship. Long story short, we fell deeply and madly in love, and I went crazy.

Today I said, ""Okay. Let's break up."" And in a rational finality, not as a threat this time.

The faded look in his eyes recently tells me enough, I've drunk the well dry.

It hasn't sunken in, I don't want our parting to be messy. I'm trying very hard to remain calm, I'm afraid to take action, to affirm the reality of our parting.

We had so many dreams, we really wanted it to work. But plans aren't meant to be followed. He's taught me a whole lot.

I know that soon I'll be in the fetal position with tissues surrounding me, scissors in hand dramatically. I'll probably ruminate over how horrible of a person I've been, how this newly diagnosed disease will probably cause me so much grief I'll choke on whatever is rising up in my chest.

I'm embarrassed, my grandmother loved him so much too, and his friends will all say to him, ""Good for you man, she was really a downer."" And I'm all too aware how selfish that irrational thought is.

Anyway, I don't have any friends after 2 years of confining myself to this relationship. No job, no prospects. If it's okay, I'd really appreciate support/advice/stories, because when I eventually break, it'd be cool to read it all.

I'm also going to start planning to move across the country now, to the West Coast, like I've been dreaming. If you have advice on that, the encouragement would be cool.

Thanks so much.

"How can I help my BPD friend? Over the break, my friend has had many issues with her mental health and I believe has been hospitalized. She's reluctant to give me any details, but I know she has issues with cutting and suicide.

So, college is starting next week. My friend just messaged the group chat and said that when we arrive on campus, we should pretend that we don't know her because we all hate her anyway.

I wish none of you had to live with the pain of this disorder, let alone the stigma and demonization that comes along with it. I know I can't. 

So many nights I was ready to end it and you lovely people helped bring me back. I can only hope that you all continue to show each other support and love and understanding like this sub's original intention.

"stopped my meds.. Hey y'all, 

I stopped taking my meds a month ago and honestly I don't think they were helpful. Trileptal helped my nightmares and insomnia but that's it. I've tried so many meds in the last year. I just wanna give up on meds honestly and try to deal with my bpd some other way. 

Any of you guys do other things to cope with your bpd? Im in therapy already. I've started journaling, trying to eat better, yoga... What's helpful for y'all? 

And as far as meds go, what are you guys on that's helped? And what should I avoid? 

Thanks so much for reading!

"Accepting BPD Hi, I am new to this sub. I was diagnosed with BPD last fall, but I just said it was bullshit and the person diagnosing me didn't know anything about me. I'm just now coming  around to idea that maybe they were right. I initially thought it was bullshit because I don't act out very much -only when I'm at my very worst- but I've kind of learned about quiet borderline and I relate to every single thing I've read. As I am somewhat coming to terms with the idea of having BPD, I'm also terrified because, of what I know at least, therapy for BPD is mainly about managing the symptoms of the emotions, such as outburst or self harm, but still having to feel all the intense feelings. I hope I'm wrong though, because I would give anything to just know that I'll feel the same way going to sleep as I did waking up- even if it's not the best feeling. I don't think I'm ready to go to therapy though because I'm just not ready to be fully open and honest with myself.","[[{'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.3867427110671997}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.13713927567005157}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.12450850009918213}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.10372792184352875}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.07746059447526932}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.07033602148294449}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.04347566142678261}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.03709304332733154}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.03045518696308136}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.022431055083870888}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.015564823523163795}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.014111589640378952}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.009816591627895832}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.006091294344514608}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.006004347000271082}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.005193306133151054}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.004509991966187954}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.004397095646709204}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.004041764885187149}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.0034242591354995966}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.0026902437675744295}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.0024249234702438116}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.0023727810475975275}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.0022021038457751274}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.0020135303493589163}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.0017681733006611466}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.0014887020224705338}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.0009921720484271646}]]"

"What should i do? Ok its a long and complicated story but ill try to explain. For the past months im “hanging” with this girl from my college class. We are in the 3 year of studies so we known each orher since 2 years now. It’s not like a love with first sight shit. Past two years i looked and her like i looked at my other classmates. This year was different, we started talking more often and often and often. Everything started when out of nowhere she asked me to went for hiking together. Since than everything changed. We went from just talking to flirting and things looked fine. But over the time i startend ( i guess) loving her and be kinda obssesed. As an anxious person that thing started to devastate me. She was on my mind like all the time. I was (and am) so confused about her feelings towards me. So i needed a solution. 1. Tell her about my feelings and ask her about something more 2. Ghosting, tell her nothing and suffer in silence. And i choose the second. This lasted one week, on second day she texted me , i just left unread, seen etc. She asked what the f is wrong with you  , whats the problem. I text her back and tell that is somtheing complicated, wrong with me not you so sorry. She insisted to know what. Ok i tell her that we should meet and make things clear. We meet, drink something like normally , talked and all this time i was processing in my mind hoe to tell her. We finished and i drive her home, and there i tell her that i dont see you as a friend anymore, and i dont want to force you over nothing so this is our last time seeing each other. At first she seemed shocked and i was expecting the line “I’m sorry, i cant ve more than your friend” But no, she said i dont want this thing, i dont want to lose you. This confused me more, though i kinda understand what she meaned, but was acting like i dont got it and asked to be more clear. She kissed me and sad am i clear now? I keeped acting confused though i enjoyed it. She said i like you too and have an affection but i want to take things slowly. I replied ok, but nor thinking that answer. We started dating , cuddling , stayed in classes together. But idea about her still gives me terrible anxiety, i cant stop thinking about her . I’m not a jelaus person  and i never was before with all my exes. She’s that type of girl that all wants, at least 3 boys in my class loves her and told their feeling. Others trying to flirt and that destroying me. The problem is that i think i love her and in other hands looked like she just likes me , just like a sexual attraction. Overthinking is destroying my life in general. I cant get out of my head that shes toying me and she sees me like a third wheel. 
I know its too long and im sorry, and sorry bout my english too , not my native language","The expanded size of the tensor (661) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.  Target sizes: [1, 661].  Tensor sizes: [1, 514]"
"Love or sex doesn't confer rights upon human beings.  “she is never under the illusion that love or sex confers rights upon human beings.

The desolate soul knows this immediately and only the trivial pretend that it can be otherwise.” -Elizabeth Hardwick","[[{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.8392131924629211}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.11634016782045364}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.054763395339250565}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.03594077005982399}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.008499734103679657}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.008234952576458454}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.004882712848484516}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.003625183831900358}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.0021147190127521753}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.0017903236439451575}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.0011136980028823018}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.0010290085338056087}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.0009883976308628917}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.0009282708051614463}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.0008574266685172915}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.0007723799208179116}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.0007281200960278511}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.0006915497360751033}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.0006900309817865491}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.0006778515526093543}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0005455620703287423}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.00046455569099634886}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.0004360520397312939}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.0003819576813839376}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.0003449183132033795}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.00032224287861026824}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.00024223422224167734}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.0002371427690377459}]]"
"Has anyone ever blocked someone because you're obsessed with the other? I've recently made [a post](https://redd.it/7n72do) about my obsession with a guy.

This has driven me crazy, so I blocked him. Not because he is bad, but it's just too much for me.

I can't handle.

- I am very poor at setting boundaries. I easily fuse with others and can't have my own identity
- It is very painful when I want someone very much but the other does not want me that much. This unbalance is a torture.
- I don't belong to where he belongs. He has a normal life, but I don't and we belong to very different worlds

I feel I need to find someone who sees or at least tries to see what I see and whose point of view is easy to understand for me...

I feel I am destroyed now.

"Recovery Tattoo So I'm scouting for anyone that thinks they may be up to the task of drawing up a tattoo. Fairly simple with a more ""pen and ink"" style...Some back story:

I'm 21. I was first psychiatrically hospitalized at age 15 for what we now know is a Borderline Personality and Bipolar Comorbid diagnoses. I struggled keeping friends, I self harmed, I cycled, I had anxiety, and I hated my birthday because it meant celebrating a life I didn't want. By age 17 I had been in the hospital 4 times, as well as 5 months in a residential treatment facility. My grades were failing because I refused to attend classes and I found out I didn't meet graduation requirements. My 18th birthday reared it's ugly head and with the feeling of failure fresh in my head, I decided I never wanted to see it come. That hospitalization was a really pivotal moment for me. I can't name a time in my life where I felt more useless. After that I went full fledge recovery. I've had 9 hospitalizations total. It has not been easy, but the past 3 years have been ultimately fruitful. I managed to graduate, I'm holding my first job, my emotions are better, and I'm maintaining more and more successful personal relationships. I have a lot of scars and I would like something to distract a little bit, mostly for my sake. I want to see something that reminds me how far I came,  rather than the mistakes I made. I'm sure people make these requests a lot so I'm not sure it'll get seen, but if anyone feels up to the task for any reason, comment below and we can figure out a way to get in touch. Stay positive folks, recovery is yours for the taking.","[[{'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.44753584265708923}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.33547863364219666}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.07469906657934189}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.06633345782756805}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.06381832808256149}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.056456126272678375}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.031587980687618256}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.019085263833403587}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.017971057444810867}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.015558846294879913}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.012542800046503544}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.011510188691318035}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.009062601253390312}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.008284430019557476}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.0077869887463748455}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.00710991071537137}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.006557374261319637}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.00637730723246932}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.00568358926102519}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.004535651300102472}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.004107133485376835}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.0041047739796340466}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.0037037921138107777}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0029148170724511147}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.002568579977378249}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.0022923366632312536}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.0010359184816479683}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.000998746370896697}]]"
"I was dating a guy with BPD and we just stopped speaking. I don't know if we're broken up or not. So I was dating a guy with BPD. I met him around spring last year. From the day we met, he was really honest with me about his disorder, telling me he was prone to mood-changes and deep anxiety. He said sometimes he'd have heaps of energy and sometimes he wouldn't even be able to leave the house. He'd call me almost daily and confide in me about his problems etc and even when we had arguments he'd want to discuss everything with me, so it felt really refreshing to have such strong communication. There were a couple of obstacles I had to deal with, like occasionally he'd text me these long emotional rants about how I should just forget about him because I deserve better etc, but it was never anything too difficult.

Anyway about 4 months ago he decided to return to education so he's been very busy studying, making new friends and he's also getting involved with evening activities as well. He seems to be doing well, only he's been too busy to make time for me. He hardly ever calls me anymore and it seems to be me who initiates texts etc. It feels like when I'm not around him he almost forgets who I am and then when I see him he's like ""oh yeah, you're the girl I'm dating, wow it's been a while"". Yet his friends say he always talks about me which I find weird because he doesn't talk TO me much these days.

The last time I saw him was 2 weeks ago. He invited me out for drinks with a few of his friends. Only something felt a bit off, like he wasn't treating me like his girlfriend, but more like someone who was dragging him down. It was nothing major, just little comments he'd make or he'd offer to buy someone else a drink but tell me ""you can get your own can't you?"". I was really hurt by his sudden change in attitude. I ended up snapping at him and said ""if you're going to act like this, then maybe I should just leave"" and he replied ""that's up to you"". I then told him to go f*ck himself. Later that night he asked if I got home okay and I said 'yes'. That was the last time we spoke. Since then I've not heard a word from him and I've not attempted to make contact. The only contact we had was when he created a new Facebook account a few days ago and sent me a friend request. I accepted and saw he'd also added a bunch of other girls. Then for some reason he deactivated his account just 2 days later and I haven't heard anything since.

I don't even know if we've broken up or not. I told myself not to contact him until he contacts me but it's been 2 weeks now and its getting a bit silly. I don't even know how it's come to this. Here I am fretting over him, and I wonder if he's even realized we're not speaking. I wouldn't be surprised if he even remembers what happened that night. Does anyone have any advice? I feel like i can't avoid him forever as I loaned him a couple of things I'd like returning at some point. I think he'd reply to me if I contacted him but something is stopping me.","The expanded size of the tensor (707) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.

"Could use some advice! This is my first post so I'm sorry if it's not up to par, but here goes nothing.
I'm an 18 year old girl with a lot on her mind. After a 2 year relationship with my second ever FP took a negative turn, I cut all contact with him and blocked him off of all social media. Lasted about 4 months, surprisingly; I found another guy who was very emotionally vulnerable immediately after, and manipulated him into falling in love with me. I hurt him as badly as I could, just to see if I could make him care for me again repeatedly during that timeframe. The game got boring, though, thus driving me back to my ex. At this point in my exes life, he was virtually homeless and hadn't any family he could rely on. I didn't care to spend time with him anymore as I'd find whenever I would, my intense feelings of love mixed with sympathy would drive me to spend too much money on him as a result of his situation. 

Without seeing him irl, I grew bored and began to play with the feelings of any guy who expressed interest in me, and quickly found a new FP in one; the guy who fell in love with me post-breakup with my ex. He had grown to resent me for hurting him so many times, so I'd put great effort into bringing his feelings back and then ignore him for days when he'd express any affection; immediately redirecting my attention to my ex. This went on for 3 months before I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. 

The intense feelings of hate I felt for myself originally, about my manipulative tendencies, my impulses and the things that brought me joy, were replaced with understanding and a desire to use this knowledge to better myself. I had to start somewhere, so I ghosted and blocked my ex. He fell for me because he was broken and easily manipulated, used me to feel better about himself, and I felt the only reason I still talked to him was because I wanted his validation when ignoring FP and that was wrong. I told FP the truth about everything; talking to my ex, the reasons why I'd do what I did, the truth behind my manipulations. He was insanely okay with everything and extremely supportive, also stopped flirting with me and started just focusing on being a good friend. He however wasn't familiar with BPD, and had no idea about the fact that I obsessed over him as I really didn't feel comfortable sharing that with him, we have too many mutual acquaintances. 

It's now one month later. Despite the initial positive reaction, over time FP started doing cocaine excessively and making passive aggressive comments towards me every time we talked as a result of all the shit I've put him through, so over time I distanced myself from him. I told him not to talk to me again after one particularly bad fight and the distance I created has made it easy to stay away. I've started seeing someone who is aware of my BPD and familiar with what it means to be with someone with BPD. We're building a fairly healthy relationship thus far, but I'm aware that as I grow closer to him, despite my best efforts it'll be increasingly difficult. I excersize when I start to feel I'm splitting, smoke weed when my negative emotions are extremely strong and sing until my brain stops being dumb when I want to get upset at him over unreasonable things. I don't want to be my BPD. 

At nights I find myself thinking of my ex, however. Tonight is one of the worst since I stopped talking to him initially. I want to stalk him so badly that I had my finger over the unblock button; just to stop and then immediately start writing this. Is it wrong that I want to see if he's okay, and explain to him that I am not well? He did contribute to a lot of the problems in our relationship, but I found out the reasoning behind why I did the things I did, and it wasn't because he let me down and didn't do the things a boyfriend should do. I'm just not sure if telling him that is taking a step backwards; he might've moved on with his life completely. I also question if I was wrong to cut off my old FP because I feel like I broke him down. Some days I feel like I'm doing well; and others I feel like my the hopelessness of my diagnosis is leading me into complete isolation slowly. I can't trust my own judgement at this point and my therapists on vacation, so I decided to write an unnecessarily long text post to distract myself from doing something I may or may not regret and hopefully receive some advice. 

Thanks for reading! I apologize once again for any errors.","The expanded size of the tensor (983) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.  Target sizes: [1, 983].  Tensor sizes: [1, 514]"

This is the first time I've ever stayed at a job for a full year. Most of my old jobs lasted 3-8 months tops.

"love when suddenly everything comes down on you i thought i was doing better and being better there hasn't been any jealousy outbursts in quite some time and i haven't felt like dying and haven't even really felt like self harming.

then recently i completely fucked up in a way with my (ex???) job because i don't have my birth certificate and it's taking forever to get it and i was so excited for this job bc it pays well for starting and full time with PTO and benefits. i went through the training and stuff so i'm really hoping that *somehow* i won't be ""fired"". but anyways i'm basically certain that i will be fired so i've just been absolutely hating myself because, wow, look at that, i fucked something else up in my life because i'm an incompetent piece of shit.

now suddenly i'm *this* close to self harming again. everything is boring. i don't draw i don't get any enjoyment from games i just flip mindlessly between different websites and read sometimes. food doesn't even taste good and now i'm extremely paranoid that because i'm so horrible and short tempered and worried my bf will hate me, that he will hate me and leave me and find someone much better who doesn't mess everything up. i love my boyfriend with all of my heart but i just don't want to live. i don't have anyone to hang out with and i haven't left the house in almost a week now. i'm really just a waste of space and time and effort and i think it would be so much better if i just disappeared.

i really love it when you think you're fine. and then suddenly your brain remembers, hey, that's right, i'm mentally ill! and it just kicks you to the ground and keeps kicking and kicking.

i was mostly looking forward to this job so i can 1) get the health benefits and see if they will cover a psychiatrist because i had to suddenly stop taking my antidepressants ~4 months ago when i moved across country, and 2) we would be able to move to an apartment that allows dogs so i could get a puppy. i want one to help motivate me to get out of the house and take walks and he may even be an emotional support animal. i dunno. i'm sorry i just really had to vent all this out somewhere, not too sure of the point of even typing all this out was","[[{'label': 'love', 'score': 0.32322072982788086}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.29491913318634033}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.12552332878112793}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.11533123254776001}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.10109178721904755}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.08118456602096558}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.06647967547178268}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.06290275603532791}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.056928057223558426}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.05594942718744278}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.029458310455083847}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.022346610203385353}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.022155923768877983}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.020892350003123283}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.017604224383831024}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.017302989959716797}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.013002161867916584}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.011716076172888279}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.01074867695569992}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.009774272330105305}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.007045707665383816}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.005859041120857}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.005055839661508799}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.004987908527255058}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.003889348590746522}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.0024209816474467516}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.0023036166094243526}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.0016096996841952205}]]"
"New to the /r asking for advice Hi!

So I just came across this subreddit (been using reddit for a while, never actually thought of looking for BPD) and I was wondering if any fellas wanted to share experiences or advice.

A little bit about me.
I’m currently 21 and living in the USA.Was diagnosed with BPD and a couple of other things at 17 after a big issue in my personal life. Before that I was just simply diagnosed with heavy depression with nihilistic thoughts.
For some time I was taking some pills for it (an antidepressant and a mood stabilizer) but around a year after I started the symptoms got worse and the pills stopped working. I dropped them and started looking after myself.
Not long after that I moved out of my house on my own and been working full time. 

I don’t really want to blame all of my issues on my disorders, but I can say that I have few acquaintances because of them.

Wanted to know from fellow users, what suggestions do you guys have for the disorder? There’s weeks where everything is peachy, but there’s that 1 day or 2 where it’s hell.

"Ego boundaries Many of us have problems with ego boundaries: they are too thin, thick or even broken (my case).  

**Here's a text on ego boundaries:**  
[Boundaries](http://soulselfhelp.on.ca/bound.html)  
________________________________________________
Seen a post today about oversharing, which is the thing that comes with thin ego boundaries. I have a big problem with that, and even when I want to stop, there is some pressure inside of me that tells me to do it, and when I start, I'm unable to stop. 
 
I usually tell people that I'm mentally ill after a few meetings with them. And as the post said, I'm not even sure that I can trust them, but I continue talking. Even though I do trust them, why should I even talk about my mental illness anyway? There are fun things to talk about, mental illnesses aren't really the appropriate topic.  

That's a huge, huuuge problem and I'm trying to avoid it, but I feel so helpless, and not only when it comes to that but also to other characteristics of thin/broken ego boundaries.  

I used to have thick ego boundaries and through my journey with BPD came to the point where I don't have them at all (or at least they are extremely weak, thin). In my opinion (which my psychiatrist agrees with), it's easier to loosen your ego boundaries than to try to create them again, because when you don't have them... You're starting from zero, and you can't build a house without any material.  
________________________________________________
What to do, where to go, I really have no idea. I'm really lost, have no identity, can't form opinions on things because I've lost my ego, can't form my own taste in things, 2 of my previous psychiatrists told me that I'm a hopeless case. When I asked them how to solve an ego boundary problem, they just told me ""I don't know"" and getting no answer made me feel even more hopeless; like there is no solution, but they are trying to hide that from me.  

I've been through psychosis, depression, anorexia, dissociation, anxiety, I've basically experienced almost every mental state that a person can be in. This situation often makes me suicidal, although I'm sure that I'm not going to do anything to myself, but you know, it just really hurts.  
________________________________________________
Here is also an example of how our ego boundaries differ from ego boundaries of a healthy individual:  
[Signs of healthy/unhealthy boundaries - PDF format](http://www.sascwr.org/files/www/resources_pdfs/incest/Signs_of_healthyunhealthy_boundaries.pdf)

"Does anyone else feel like they're fine until they're not? Sometimes I think I don't even have borderline. Sometimes I think I'm making it all up. Sure, my head gets loud. No, I don't really know what I'm feeling. And yes, I'm incessantly bored. But my life is together, I don't have outbursts, for the most part I take care of myself. There are times when my DBT program feels horribly derivative because *of course* I know how to regulate my emotions and no I don't need to do my homework because I'm a fucking adult and my feelings aren't a school project. And I find it so hard to articulate to my therapist that, really, everything is fine and they shouldn't take me seriously...

And then I'm cutting myself again. At work, no less, without warning. Then I can't get out of bed in the mornings. Then I'm going home with strangers and having a breakdown in their stairwell. I'm a 30 year old man, mind you. This is not a good look for me, or anyone for that matter. But really, *truly*, I'm fine. I'm really just making all this up.

"I cut out a friend.. Feeling bad He recently went back to visit his family in another country and things got strained. He and I had a brief fling but nothing to serious and decided we're better as friends. When he was here, we saw each other every week for drinks with our other friends and messaged everyday. Since he went away, he's been distant. I was understanding but then I realised how he wasn't really acting the same or like he was interested in any thing I had to say. I became clingy and felt myself losing self esteem and getting more and more hurt. I decided to block him and tell him that I don't want us to be friends anymore. I needed to block or or I'd just be tempted to talk to him again. I just don't want to have a one sided friendship like this. It hurts because I now realise how I valued our friendship more than he did, clearly, but I'm not angry at him.

"My girlfriend has BPD. She is making my life miserable and I don't know what to do. It's so difficult for me because I find myself sacrificing *so much* for her. I sacrifice so much time spent making friends and pursuing my interests in order to spend time with her. And she finds some way to be angry at me every few days. I'm constantly stressed by her when she's upset, yet I'm so happy with her when she's happy. 

I feel like I lost control of my life. I feel like I constantly have to reassure her and make her feel loved. But I don't get that in return all the time. I don't have any unconditional love. If I mess up a lot, then she brings up breakups. If I make her feel unsure about our relationship, then she brings up breakups. If I take even *one day* to try and pursue my hobbies without her, then she brings up breakups. 

It's so difficult because when we're happy, we're *so incredibly happy.* There's no feeling that can replace it. But when she's upset, it feels like the whole damn world is about to end. And it's a roller coaster. 

The worst part is she assumes the worst from me before anything even happens. If I tell her to wait 1 hour before we call (long distance), then she'll tell me that it's because I don't want to talk to her and I'm trying to push it back as far as I can to avoid her. 

It's taxing on my mentality. But I don't know what to do because I try my best to communicate my intentions to her but it just doesn't work. If she's upset, very few things can bring her back other than time. If she starts to get a little upset, then it snowballs and becomes an avalanche. 

I try really really really really hard. And it's so rewarding and I'm so happy that I sacrifice for her - most of the time. But when she has an episode... it makes me question myself. 

Help please. And please don't judge me - this was a very difficult post for me to write and I've spent the past year feeling like a mix between the best boyfriend in the world and the biggest piece of shit that the Earth could produce.","[[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.3899972438812256}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.34725186228752136}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.0821080282330513}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.06098353490233421}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.04062032699584961}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.03960547223687172}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.0371384359896183}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.03032526932656765}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.025883711874485016}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.017714248970150948}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.014796538278460503}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.011490154080092907}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.010067939758300781}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.009991755709052086}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.008244804106652737}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.007570317015051842}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.005372310988605022}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.005294933449476957}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.005004017613828182}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.004508501850068569}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.004341264721006155}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.0031641016248613596}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.00312238372862339}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.002691880566999316}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.0021213807631284}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.0016555829206481576}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.0013247921597212553}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0012528629740700126}]]"
"BPD lowkey makes it easier for people to fall in love with you? If nobody else relates to this I'm gunna feel like a twat. BPD obviously sucks, but the one (kind of) upside that I think about regularly is that since people with BPD struggle finding a sense of self and tend to copy mannerisms and phrases and things from their FP, it's super easy to get someone to totally fall in love with you. The whole ""oh my god I found my soulmate"" type of thing. Having someone be so seemingly similar to you and who thinks the sun rises and sets with you is kind of the ultimate fairytale ideal.

"I saw my ex yesterday and I have complicated feelings about it It was a messy break up. We broke up a few years ago. It was my most emotionally unstable period. We were about to get married but I got really sick and he fucked off. I was in hospital (psych) twice that summer and I was seeing the police multiple times a week because of my mental health issues. I was a high risk missing person once. It was the lowest point of my life probably. 

So anyway I bumped into him yesterday. He had one of his legs amputated because he got into an accident with his motorbike. He now has a fake leg I think. He was in a wheelchair. I knew about the accident but I didn't go see him mainly because the break up was so bad and I thought it would be unwise. His family don't like me for example. Honestly, part of me also thought it was simply some extreme karma.


I just feel weird about the whole thing. He told me i cursed him. I told him that I might have said some horrible things but didn't curse him. (I hope you get hit by a bus etc.) He kept asking me whether I cried when I found out about the accident. I told him I didn't because why lie?


Part of me misses him now. Seeing him brought it all back. It was a really shit relationship but a relationship nevertheless. I can't believe i'll never hold him again. I won't go back to him for sure but it's just crazy how we are strangers now. I don't even have his number. We agreed not to exchange numbers when I saw him.","[[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.7091488242149353}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.2864128351211548}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.06956902146339417}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.05980269983410835}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.05914336442947388}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.04227348044514656}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.031108153983950615}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.024251703172922134}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.0225335955619812}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.014806830324232578}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.013193685561418533}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.012120461091399193}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.011787058785557747}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.01140658464282751}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.01056846883147955}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.010266232304275036}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.009068825282156467}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.00871802493929863}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.0066286795772612095}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.004373430740088224}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.003886776277795434}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.002561827190220356}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.002113308757543564}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.0018892418593168259}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.0017745811492204666}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.0017484615091234446}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.00042812537867575884}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.0003367399040143937}]]"

"thinking all actions are intentional hi bpd friends!

my mother has bipolar definitively, but also seems to have borderline (she has all the symptoms, not to mention has childhood trauma and an abusive household growing up). either way, she has a lot of the symptoms.

my question is, do you guys tend to attribute all actions as intentional?

my mom does this a lot, and it creates some problems for us. for example, when i was in high school, i would accidentally do something or forget something and she would be like ""why did you do that? just to piss me off??"" assuming it was intentional. she also attributes emotions and intentions to other people very regularly. she'll say things like ""i know you did that for ____"" assuming my emotions/intentions onto me. usually she is wrong about that-- she'll assume i didn't call her because i don't love her, not because i'm busy.

is this common? how do you guys think i should respond?

thanks everyone, i wish you all luck on your recovery journey.","[[{'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.5079087018966675}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.24999454617500305}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.2226322591304779}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.09561824798583984}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.07354069501161575}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.0687975361943245}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.023073840886354446}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.01892903260886669}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.011801992543041706}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.011531155556440353}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.009122266434133053}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.006444403901696205}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.006212984211742878}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.004702309612184763}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.0046245986595749855}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.004163420293480158}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.0039016639348119497}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.003125931601971388}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.002934367163106799}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.002421032404527068}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.002272960962727666}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.002173286397010088}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.001811970490962267}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.0018104281043633819}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.0011816511396318674}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.0010326500050723553}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.000885647488757968}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.0005468380404636264}]]"
"how do you meet/date/go out with new people hi

weird question. whats the best way to meet/date/go out with new people? im in this weird almost liminal state of coming home from work motivating myself to enough to like sorta work out and eat relatively okay, followed by weekends of sort of loud abrasive old friends getting drunk together. 

it becomes maddening to me and i feel like i'm stuck and sort of alone. dating apps never work for dating, the meetup groups around my area are sort of lame, im not really sure what to do. i was thinking of starting my own meetup group but i already have so many expenses that im not sure i can really afford it. 

im not miserable or suicidal for the record, which is a positive step. i love my job, and my life as a whole is going okay. i dont want to move (at least yet) but i need some sort of dramatic change. any advice?

"I thought I was doing well! (20f) 
Hi everyone been lurking for a while.
So just over a year now since I was formally diagnosed with BPD.  To put it short my anxiety's the worst which has kind twisted into a mild OCD ( constantly checking appliances in fear of a fire). My depression; most of the time I'm fine but some days always in the afternoon even if I've had a really good day, my mood will suddenly  deplete. My mind feels different, cloudy and a feeling of dreadfulness. I have to work hard to bring my mood back up and calm myself down. 
Impulses, I've been able to stop over the top spending on clothes thank God, and it's almost been a year since I've had sex.  

attachment; I guess I'm on the other end of the spectrum. I got sick of breaking down when people left my life,  so I stopped emotionally investing myself in people because I'm afraid of attachment. I need to find somewhere in the middle. 

I feel like through 2017 I made a lot of progress. I wanted to take responsibility for my actions and stop using BPD and my period as an excuse for losing my temper. I made a lot of progress when I start to heat up I calm myself down.

But lately I literally have zero control. My anxiety has really reduced. But my temper. Jesus Christ!
A couple of weeks ago I was crossing the road I was halfway across when a taxi driver saw me and kept going stopped right up to me and the cheek to honk at me. When I made it across he gave me a dirty look. And I guess by that point it was too late. Without a thought I just yelled at him "" don't you fucking beep at me!!!!"" And we continued to argue. 
Today my dad is taking me for a drive, we were at the light my dad didn't realise that it was green and someone started beeping at him. Like lightning my body was struck by heat, my body lunged forward and I had this image rush into my head of rolling down that wind poking my head out of the car and screaming "" who the fuck is beeping at us?!? 😡😡😡. "" Then I was like wait no, dad would think I'm a psycho. 

I feel like I've got the mind of a dog I had been snippy with my dad all morning too. What the fuck is going on, I have zero control, it's all impulse, my body and mouth have a mind of it's own and I fucking hate it.

TL;DR I'm degenerating.","The expanded size of the tensor (561) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.  Target sizes: [1, 561].  Tensor sizes: [1, 514]"
"Did my FP just tell me to kill myself? We were texting about how I've been feeling (pretty bad and very confused) and and after I told him something about how I feel, he said well if that's true, death is an answer...

Someone please tell me I'm just misinterpreting what he is saying, because otherwise WTF?

I'm also feeling weirdly detached from this.

"I feel like I'm feeling someone else's feelings/emotions – dissociation?? hi,

I am honestly not sure if this is the right place to ask this but I’ve searched the web for days and haven’t found any answers.

background info: I'm 26, female, diagnosed with BPD (among other stuff) in 2010.

I’ve had some weird feelings and I don’t know if this could be dissociation. it’s very hard to explain to someone, even my therapist didn’t really get what I meant, so I’m hoping maybe someone else has felt similarly and can help me. I’ve read about dissociation, depersonalization and derealization and I don’t seem to meet the actual criteria, yet the only explanation I have for what I’ve been experiencing is some form of dissociation. let me explain:

the simplest and most ""concise"" way to describe it would be: I feel like my feelings and emotions are not my own, like they’re someone else’s. 

what I mean by this is: sometimes I get feelings that don’t fit my current situation or surroundings. there is no reason for me to feel like this, as if I’m just randomly feeling someone else’s feelings. these feelings can be very strong to the point where I feel uneasy or even scared or paranoid – all while being perfectly aware that I am not currently in any situation that would justify feeling like this. I KNOW where and who I am, the conscious part of my brain is fully aware of what is happening and is trying to be reasonable, but the feelings are still there, and sometimes very intense. I know there is no actual reason for feeling like this, yet the feelings are very real to me.

the most common emotions/feelings I experience are best described like this: I feel as if I’m a person who’s been kidnapped or something (seems super dramatic but?), they’ve just found themselves in a place they don't know; they can’t trust anyone, can’t be seen, and have to get out of there but they don’t know how. they’re scared, anxious, paranoid, confused, sad. this is how I feel. but I KNOW I’m not in any situation that would justify it. it’s so hard to explain. but this is what I feel most of the time. again: I do NOT feel as if I am really in that situation. they’re just feelings, not actual thoughts or beliefs, if that makes sense.

anyone know what this could be?? it's so draining and I wanna try to fix it but I need to know what I'm dealing with first…

*(additional info: feel like people might ask me about childhood trauma, honestly I don’t consciously remember anything but for all I know it is pretty possible. so, it could be part of the reason but I might never know. also, my parens have been emotionally neglecting me throughout my whole life and are generally not what you'd call A+ parents, just a little side note; they tolerate me living with them still because I don't have a job atm but they want me out asap. it's stressful because there is a certain tension in the air at all times; not really a loving family bond here. I generally try to avoid them a lot.)*

**TL;DR:** is it possible to ""dissociate"" but be aware of it? can you feel things that seem in no way connected to your current situation? can you feel as if you are feeling someone else’s feelings/emotions? as if you’re literally disconnected from your feelings? and what does it mean? 

thanks for any advice &amp; replies!

"What am I doing? So these days I often skip school because I'm just feeling too awful. My school knows about my mental state so they don't punish me for skipping.

But today, I skipped classes again. I wasn't even feeling that bad, just tired because I went to bed late. But I felt like I was actually wrong for skipping class because I wasn't feeling awful.. So to make me feel like I had a reason to skip class, I started selfharming. Because if I selfharm clearly I'm in a bad place etc and I have reason to skip class..

Is this what's called manipulating? In a way? Since I now indeed have a ""reason"" to skip class since I'm selfharming?

"break up from LT SO, need of some BPD support Hello fam. my LT fb has just broken up with me. he said it was because he was not enough for me, but im sure the dealing with an intense BPD gf has not made it easy for a boy (i am the girl) who is almost very unemotional, uncaring compared to me. I do not want to spiral and am feeling ok right now and have some support networks coming by soon. But I want some tips and support from those who suffer from same as me because I know you know how hard this is, because we are emotional and our feelings are real. I didn't expect this, for me everything was amazing and it was getting so much better, but for him, he loves me but he just cannot be in a realtionship with me anymore. He cant provide me with what I need and He says I deserve better. His family is like my own, and I am scared to be left alone. I just lost my job because of University and travel plans with him (now cancelled), I knew that I was going to rely on his support for this, but now I wont. I am quite terrified of not having his house to go to, or his family. My family has always been the toxic roots to my mental illness issue, and I am so scared to be here, with no income and be stuck in one home. Help me be strong. Normally in a break up, I behave in toxic manners such as rebounding, or drug abuse, or ranting... But i know this time it wont be the same and I hope to grief properly.

"I haven’t hung out with a person in over four months I had a great group of friends back in September. They were my roommates and I didn’t hesitate to call them family. Then my BPD went crazy and I ended up in the hospital. After that they completely cut me off as a person. 

I still live with them and hear them everyday. I have to stick it out with them until the current semester is over. I hate knowing that every time I walk through the door they are pissed I’m back again. Once in a while I’ll hear them say “oh is *blank or *blank home”. Never my name since they don’t acknowledge me as a person anymore. 

I’m just so sick of hurting others I have decided to stop trying to make new friendships. I can’t hurt anyone but myself if I stay in my room alone. Sure it’s a sad life, but no matter what I did anyways I would still feel that emptiness. 

I have to sleep every night knowing I hurt so many people in my life. By being too attached and then screaming at them when they do something that slightly upsets me. I carry around a weight with me as if everyone I’ve known has died. Because they might as well have.  Knowing I’m dead to them. 

My roommates, the people I once loved so much. Won’t look at me. I hate the feeling of shame and guilt everyday.

I became paranoid and insecure and began to question her about everything to try and catch her in a lie because in my mine I wasn't good enough, so there must have been someone else. 

However saying her issue caused my issue is apparently deflection because she accused me of gaslighting first. Anything you try to explain after that is taken as gaslighting. You're just supposed to accept what they tell you and move on? I'm just supposed to let them define me and that's that?

Even if I fully admit to it and the pain it caused her, do the communication lines not open so we can talk about the entire scenario? I feel like she completely cast my feelings to the side and I'm just supposed to take it because that's what her therapist told her.

Then decided we could work on things.

Then changed her mind.

Then agreed to work on things.

Then changed her mind.

I thought she'd come back. I thought she'd change her mind.

I called her. Way too much. I texted. Way too much.

She threatened to call the police. She called my mom.

I just don't understand why she doesn't want me. I tried to treat her so good. I took her on vacation for her birthday. I was going to propose. I bought her a ring. She said she wanted to be with me forever. Like..last week she said this.

I introduced her to my daughter. Even when I thought she was going to break up with me, she promised she wasn't and that it was safe for her to be around my daughter again.

I don't fucking get why she doesn't want me anymore.

It's almost been a month. I still think of her every single day and I just can't get her out of my fucking head. 

And she wants nothing at all to do with me.

My therapy is helping, but slowly. I still slip up and catch myself thinking about her again. About what I could have done differently.

I know what I have to do. I have to get over her. I have to leave her behind and quit fooling myself that she'll come back.

I know that will ultimately end up with me sleeping around and fucking her memory away....but the thought of it scares me. I don't want to lose this. I don't want to lose the love she made me feel.

"Just got into a huge argument with my BF over reassurance I got upset and started to spiral because he didn’t reassure me at a point when I needed it. I was starting to feel like he wasn’t as interested in our plans when I expressed my excitement and he did not. 

Eventually it just got heated. I just told him all I needed and all I wanted was to hear he was happy to get to spend time with me that I don’t know why it is such an issue for him to do so. He said that the fact that he made the plans in the first place should make it obvious that he wants to spend time with me. 

I told him that it isn’t so obvious to me, that i do need more reassurance than a normal person and that’s a need I’ve been expressing to him since day one. His initial excuse for not providing reassurance is that that kind of stuff doesn’t cross his mind. He said he thinks words don’t mean as much as action and his actions should speak louder. He told me he thinks it’s ridiculous that just because I over analyze a situation he needs to reassure me. 

He’s being so insensitive and I have been trying so hard to remain calm and not get abusive or make any personal attacks toward him. My heart is broken I am devastated. 

He is basically refusing to meet a need that I have never kept hidden or have suddenly sprung on him because he doesn’t “express” well and I should accept that about him. That it’s who he is. 

Am i wrong in this situation? Is there something I should be doing? Is there a way I can explain to him that he may understand that this isn’t something that I can easily change about myself?

"Self-Image and BPD + Discord Server So first of all, I have a BPD discord server! If you wanna join and talk to me and other people, feel free to have a look https://discord.gg/QZtdyyz Thank you so much. Anyway...

So I find a lot of my BPD symptoms intensify for a while, then go away or at least settle down, which means I'm over a lot of the symptoms... Kind of. So one thing that's been very intense lately is my self image. Most of you will think I'm talking about the lack of identity but honestly it's not really that anymore.

I think I'm an asshole. Or at least, I know my BPD wants me to think I am. Logically, I'm a pretty good partner and I care for them greatly, I'm a supportive friend, and I have a good understanding for other people and a lot of perspective. But I still get my BPD nagging at me, telling me I'm a terrible person and that I'm just going to end up hurting my partner, emotionally of course. 

I think this is partly due to my parents, partly due to how much of an ass I definitely can be when I'm really, really angry. Either way I don't know how to get over this.

"How to stop acting so damn creepy and obsessive over my FP? So. My current favourite person is this girl in my college program. We have all of our classes together and normally she, another girl, and I all sit together in class. She is a few years older than me and for the passed few months I have become increasingly enamoured over her. We have a group chat between the three of us (fp, me and another girl) and I am constantly checking it, seeing when she was last online, if she read my message, etc. 
I post on my snapchat story, instagram, twitter, etc. and constantly check to see if she has viewed my posts or posted anything herself. 
I google her name, look at her online profiles, etc etc etc.
It makes me upset that her and our other friend text outside of our group chat when neither of them message me individually. The other girl even told me that she had gone on ""ghost mode"" after I added her on snapchat so that I couldn't view her location on the map (even though I keep my ""stalker-ish"" behaviors private.)

I have such a hard time acting normal around her and am constantly seeking validation from her.
The other day I couldn't find the two of them at school, and instantly felt brokenhearted that they had ditched me forever and never wanted to speak to me or see me again. They messaged me then saying where they were and everything was fine.

I overshare, and the two of them have already mentioned the fact that they think I have alcoholism. Not. Good. 
WHY CANT I HAVE NORMAL RELATIONSHIPS.
I just really crave the attention of people that I like. I hate myself for it.
I know that this behaviour is beginning to get out of hand. I don't want to scare her away, I just don't know how to interact in any other way.
I have few close friends in general, and zero support system outside of my once a month therapy sessions. Any advice? I feel like I am about to do something even more stupid to hurt myself soon.
Please share any tips or support.","[[{'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.5031945705413818}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.3395257294178009}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.14477448165416718}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.09197171777486801}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.06236756965517998}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.04878693073987961}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.04562683030962944}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.043651580810546875}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.035765718668699265}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.03263430297374725}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.02851659618318081}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.01902301050722599}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.016985565423965454}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.015011526644229889}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.011770308017730713}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.009857523255050182}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.0069390092976391315}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.006850233767181635}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.006374255754053593}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.006055868696421385}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.005766733083873987}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.005168147850781679}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.0033064773306250572}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.0026970263570547104}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.002686126157641411}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.0008608604548498988}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.0006553208804689348}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.0003267857537139207}]]"

"Does anyone else sometimes experience anger and annoyance when people are kind or compliment you or say nice things about you? Like most people with BPD, I desperately want the approval and validation of others. But as I get older, instead of being flattered and pleased if someone gives me a compliment, or acts friendly to me, or does something loving, I find my myself feeling flat out anger. 

Its really complex; on one hand, I get angry because  when someone says something positive about me or treats me with kindness, I feel like they’re delusional and not in reality. Because in my head, I think if they really knew who I was at my very core, they wouldn’t be nice to me. Because I cannot shake that profound feeling that I’m utterly worthless. And I honestly don’t know that any amount of therapy could ever get rid of that. And in some sick way, I guess although it hurts, it makes more logical sense if someone is treating me like crap. 

Another reason I feel anger is that I have this part of me that feels like compliments and kindness are patronizing. It’s like someone is dangling this thing I desperately want in front of my face, and that gives them power over me. Because I usually feel completely powerless in my life. 

All of this came to mind today because I’m using a dating app, and this guy that I feel is way out of my league sent me a really nice message and told me that he liked my profile and said how sexy and beautiful he thought I was. And I responded (perhaps wrongly) by saying, “Really?” And he said, “Yes of course! You don’t agree?”

And so then I was honest and told him that no, I don’t agree. We ended up talking for quite a bit, and he is very kind, but him being perplexed as to why I would question the idea that I’m not sexy and beautiful made me so mad! I wanted to shake him and say “Are you an idiot?? Isn’t it painfully obvious that I’m a worthless piece of shit and that you’re just talking out of your ass!?!?”

So yeah, I’m fucked up. I desperately want to feel good about myself and who I am, but refuse to acknowledge any evidence that supports that idea.

"somewhat a sequel to my previous post A while back I posted how at my job I was told 'I'm positive and happy but how i was a functioning heroin addict with crippling depression and BPD'. In the comments sections I received alot of questions about being a high functioning heroin addict, quiting, etc. I just wanted to updated everyone and let you guys know that I've quit heroin with the savior drug of Buprenorphine (AKA Suboxone). But now it seems instead if covering my hurt and wounds inside with heroin and opiates I've turned to benzos (my fave D.O.C)... After being told by [previously a 'good' friend] that my benzo use was obvious I have now turned coke to wake up, coke for energy to get me through the day at work, and coke after work so I can clean/cook/take care of my bills, life, or whatever. And benzos only when I do too much coke and it gives me anxiety or benzos when i need to come down and sleep.

I guess there was no real point to this post, just a 'vent'. Sometimes it feels like a vicious endless cycle, sometimes I want to end it all since it's seemingly hopeless.

"How do you get over the loss of friends? Lost friends recently. They were close to me in a multitude of ways and I’m having problems coping. One didn’t seem into the friendship so I had to end that as they hadn’t replied to me in weeks and I knew the texts were going through, the other had issues beyond my control that destroyed our friendship - they had intense lying issues that made me insecure about the friendship constantly.

"Comorbid disorders. I have BPD but also OCD. My OCD is worse. Will DBT help or should I do CBT? I'm only asking this question because the therapy is so damn expensive. I'm looking at 2,500$ for a 6 month course of DBT (one weekly group therapy and once weekly therapy with a PH.D. Student). 

I was molested as a child and as a result, have CPTSD which seemed to be diagnosed as BPD by some professionals and as CPTSD by others. Either way, I'm sure DBT is helpful for CPTSD also. 

I have rather debilitating OCD...it's what I struggle the most with. The OCD is not based in fear though, it is based in shame. Exposure therapy is not effective because I constantly expose myself to my OCD and it makes no difference. My obsession is with some deep scars in my face and my compulsion takes up countless hours of my day and a ton of mental energy. I'm at my breaking point.

Will DBT help simultaneously with my supposed BPD and shame-based OCD? I say supposed BPD because it does not interfere with my life much, and my abandonment fears center around my romantic relationships only. I don't have extreme swings of emotion anymore, just a pervasive lack of self esteem and a daily feeling of depression and anxiety.

"Making excuses to break up with someone Everytime I’m in a relationship after the initial honeymoon phase is over and things start to become more comfortable and regulated, that’s when the switch flips for me. I go from being head over heels for a person to only focusing on the things that annoy me about them and making excuses as to why I should dump them, even if nothing is going wrong in the relationship. Once things get complacent I feel a strong need to start chaos. The relationship I’m in now is the healthiest relationship I’ve ever been in and yet I still run circles in my head all the time trying to decide whether I actually love this person or not. It’s hard to differenciate between my BPD feelings and my actual feelings if that makes sense. I know I’m probably splitting on him right now but I can’t help but focus on all the bad parts of our relationship. I have a strong urge to break up with him before he breaks up with me. 

I know that if I’m being rational, our relationship is perfectly healthy but my BPD keeps making up these ‘bad parts’ that hardly even exist and blowing them out of proportion. It’s very frustrating.

"I’ve always wanted a family of my own but the more I’m in the therapy the more I think it’d be extremely selfish to have kids with the risk of inheriting BPD Basically what the title says. 

My family is and always has been extremely difunctional. Way too much to get into here but I’ve gathered that it’s the reason I’ve always made finding an SO and starting a family an important goal I’d like to have in my life.

But I started going to therapy about 8 months ago and the more we discuss me and my past, the more I see that some of the things that I get upset over now are things that are similar to behaviors my mom had when I was growing up. 

I’ve started seeing this more and more and it started making me think that there’s going to be a good chance of me passing all of this garbage on to any kids I may have. 

Not to mention the annoyance I’d become to a SO. 

I’m not saying that my decision is final but im now very reluctant to get into any relationship. Yeah, I could get better over the next few years and learn to control things but what if I don’t? What if I assume I’ll get better, get into a relationship, then realize down the line that I’m not getting better? I can either end things with the person which I see as a shit move or just continue things and then risk fucking up my families lives just because I wanted to be selfish and start a family. 

I’ve been thinking about it for a while and I guess I made the decision to hold off on relationships for a while until I’m better. Has anyone else had this happen to them?

**TL;DR** I’ve always had the dream of starting my own loving family after having a very dysfunctional one growing up. But through therapy I’m seeing similarities in the way I think/act  to how my mom acted when I was growing up and now I don’t want to risk passing this condition on to any potential kids and I don’t want to ruin a “normal” SOs life with a long term relationship with me. I’m feeling a bit lost right now since that was a big positive goal in my life.

"Locking your phone during an episode? I hate that I call a million times when I'm acting up, and send a bunch of text that range from manipulating ""pity me"" messages to fullblown anger. I ALWAYS regret it in the morning. 

I feel it would be great if there was an app that could just completely turn off any ability to communicate for a couple of hours. Please tell if you have any good tips on apps or functions! I have an android.

What I've tried already:

* Different productivity / don't look at the phone apps. However they are super easy to bypass, and usually you can still see from the lockscreen if someone has sent you a message (I don't want to know if the person I want to spam has contacted me, it's very triggering if they haven't)

* When I lived at home I would ask my Dad to hide my phone. It worked great in the beginning but then I got to be ace at finding it. And now I'm a responsible adult (lol) living by myself

"Wife has untreated BPD and it's threatning out marriage I'll do my best to be concise. My wife known about her BPD since she was around 16 or 17. We've been together for 4 years and got married in June of 2017. 

One of her co-workers also has some similar mental health issues and they bonded over it and began talking to each other in a way that I would describe as very sentimental. I spoke to her about my unease with the nature of their texts and she said it was just a way to pump her self esteem up, though I was still not totally comfortable I know she has issues with self worth and I don't want her to feel worthless so I shut up about it because truth be told I was happy she had a friend to confide in even though I secretly wished she would come to me for that type of support (not necessarily instead of him, but as well as him).

Fast forward to 2 weeks ago, I'm using her phone to play music on spotify and he sends her a text that says ""I can still smell you in my sheets"". I'm very alarmed and ask her about it, she explains his partner just left town and he probably sent it to my wife by mistake. I believe her although I'm distraught over it the rest of the day. 

That night I get insecure and look through their message history (not my proudest moment) and there are a lot of really mushy texts but nothing to be worried about really. Then I remember she uses Instagram sometimes to message people, and it's there that I come across very sexually explicit texts and one saying that meeting him was the best thing to happen to her in 2017. I'm crushed.

I confronted her about it all and she told me that she was sorry but nothing happened between them, it was just a crush and nothing to worry about. I spent a night at my brothers and came back ready to work it out. That's when I saw they were still messaging. I told her it needed to stop, she agreed. Things were okay for a few days, and then there were more sexually overt messages. 

Finally I'm fed up, I go to her work to confront the guy who won't respect the fact that I'm married to the woman I love and upon confronting him he is shocked to discover that our marriage is not open. She had led him to believe we were in an open relationship and that I was okay with everything. He said anything I needed to know he would answer honestly.

Turns out they had hooked up a few times, the message about him smelling her on his sheets was indeed intended for her, and up to this point he was under the impression we had a healthy open marriage.

I spoke with her after all was said and done and asked why. Reasons she gave me were that I didn't do enough housework and she felt underappreciated for the work she did, that my libido is considerably higher that hers and it made her feel inadequate so she went outside the marriage to feel more like she could satisfy a person's sex drive, and that I'm boring and the newness of everything was gone.

Now I'm here picking up the pieces and trying to decide if I can learn to trust her again, if I'm willing to put in the work, toand what I could have done to be a better husband.","The expanded size of the tensor (707) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.

"Beginning to understand, but will I ever fully comprehend? It feels a little better to see a therapist, to get a BPD diagnosis, to feel like I am not alone in my crazy, but I am scared that I won't overcome this, that my feelings will continue to steer me into doing inappropriate things to my loved ones, or cause me to miss opportunites due to self-doubt, procrastination, all the negative manifestations of my emotions. I guess I just have to continue to come up with ways to 'snap out of it' because a lot of this self-revalation is due to my partner (of 9 months) desiring me to change for the better, giving me insight when i cannot see what I am truly doing. *Sigh* I guess the first step is knowing then seeking help.

"Amazing results with 5HTP in the winter, terrible results in the summer Hey people,

This isn't an advert or intended to make people take something, do your own research, this just is my experience, we're all different :)
(also please be careful as 5htp is very dangerous when combined with some medications, especially SSRI's, I'm not on any prescribed medication) 


I became very suicidal due to many things including undiagnosed chronic pain and my GP has tried to convince me that it is all in my head... 5htp (Griffonia Simplicifolia extract) has pulled me out of depression, I'm not craving sugar or alcohol, far less mood swings, and no suicidal thoughts. It has also made me able to focus on the positive techniques I am learning in my therapy group. 


However when I took it last summer (in South America), it made me manic, more manic than I have ever been and very irritable/prone to anger. I'm not sure but maybe it has something to do with our serotonin levels, which are naturally high in sunny weather but lower in the winter.

So that's my experience, I enjoy taking herbal supplements so will post about any that have had a good effect on me. Lemon balm and passion flower is great for me in the summer. 

It's early days (a week), but it's been the only thing this winter that has stabilised my mood, I will probably cycle it every few months to make sure it stays effective, and stick to lemon balm in the summer. 

It's not a miracle cure, I still feel some things intensely, I'm just less likely to react to them. Which is great :)

Good luck people, stay strong","[[{'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.5511676073074341}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.33371230959892273}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.1455208659172058}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.1249835193157196}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.08783239871263504}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.0600452721118927}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.05564083531498909}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.051372457295656204}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.03658590838313103}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.03566177189350128}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.03133929893374443}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.03087165765464306}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.026237811893224716}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.022276785224676132}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.015594645403325558}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.01482680719345808}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.012954078614711761}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.010840621776878834}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.00894413236528635}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.006668612360954285}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.006158803589642048}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.004017516504973173}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.003746824571862817}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.0037461002357304096}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.003322926815599203}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.003183883149176836}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.001687607611529529}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.001541038160212338}]]"
"How BPD is Portrayed in TV - Shameless So I've been more aware lately of how TV is portraying people with BPD as psycho/crazy/nuts and it hurts. Think of Cassidy (Carl's girlfriend) in Shameless. Tell me she's not borderline? In the last episode the whole family (besides Frank) was telling Carl not to marry her. And I actually took it personally. Wow. My husband and I watch this show together and I always say he's just like Kev - patient, loving, a little ditzy and comes off as a ""blonde"". And last night I realized I'm just like Cassidy. Not to the extreme that she is though, but the freaking out she does when she feels abandoned by Carl. 

Anyways, I feel like the show doesn't really depict the other side of BPD. Like how Cassidy feels or what causes her to feel fearful of abandonment? It just shows her being psychotic every episode. 

Thoughts? Other shows you've noticed this in?","[[{'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.48184603452682495}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.16867972910404205}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.14554576575756073}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.12400064617395401}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.09801141172647476}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.08255000412464142}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.07014025002717972}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.05257470905780792}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.027357259765267372}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.021769383922219276}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.015542072243988514}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.014585182070732117}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.014378516934812069}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.0135024543851614}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.010568234138190746}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.009561304934322834}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.007363657467067242}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.0062600732780992985}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.005984373390674591}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.005967887584120035}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.004770307336002588}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.00417166855186224}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.004034535028040409}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.0030516290571540594}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.0026364128571003675}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.0024622913915663958}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.0012777664232999086}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.0004406381631270051}]]"
"Hypomania after starting tablets?? Yesterday morning i started lamotrigine and buspirone. 
Lastnight my thoughts were racing. 
About science and experiments etc. 

I was fully focused and felt if i had the ways and means of testing my ideas - it would be a good experiment. I could see myself working in the scientific field. Not really since im not qualified in the slightest, but felt my ideas were good enough, if you get me.

Before the meds my mood had been quite flat. After a period of depression over the christmas, i was no longer depressed but not, not depressed either. If that makes sense. 

I felt so energized by my thoughts and felt quite good. It is not an unfamiliar feeling as i have been here on many occasions, only with different things. Usually involving science. This time it was about the brain, consciousness and a coma. Other times it has been about space, time travel, alternate  universes. Alternate universes were included with last nights thoughts. 

Usually topics with endless questions and answers. 

Last time i was at this point i had started sertraline. Yesterday i started lamotrigine. 
It does come about without medication, but i am seeing medication being a possible trigger. 

Is it possible for it to have this affect hours after having a dose of lamotrigine, or is it likely to be psychological?","[[{'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.36106330156326294}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.1750144064426422}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.16371485590934753}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.08778458088636398}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.07998857647180557}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.06215418875217438}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.043449193239212036}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.04029731824994087}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.028773384168744087}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.022056782618165016}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.01661527343094349}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.015760740265250206}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.01534367073327303}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.01305427961051464}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.011240839958190918}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0076411715708673}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.006425322964787483}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.005097060929983854}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.004402645397931337}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.0033550679218024015}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.0026554742362350225}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.002235576743260026}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.0017516703810542822}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.001700580003671348}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.0014729881659150124}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.0012573075946420431}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.0007432228303514421}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.0006082020117901266}]]"
"Watched a movie that hit too close to home Last night I watched the movie ""I, Tonya"" about the former figure skater Tonya Harding and damn, did it depress the shit out of me. Everything that happened could have been prevented if her mother just loved her. She just wanted to be loved and looked for it in the wrong place w/the wrong guy. My mom wasn't so blatantly cruel as hers, but I empathized w/her: desperate for love, not recognizing when someone treats you like crap because that's what you've been use to your whole life, being demonized... And then of course I felt like a horrible person for believing that she was the one behind the ""incident."" And because I (and the rest of the world) believed it, she was banned for life from doing the only thing she loved. 

I watched the movie w/a group of people and of course I was the only one w/such strong reactions. I hate that a movie can affect me so much.

"Having a low point So I’m in the beginning stages of a relationship with a man who, thankfully, has known me for over a decade and knows about my BPD. He has so far stuck with me while still attempting to maintain his own boundaries, things like not friending me on social media yet as I have, in the past, gone looking for reasons to believe he is seeing someone else. We tried at the beginning, but I started getting a little weird with it and when I got upset at one point and deleted him at one point, he decided it would be best if he made it a boundary for us to stay off each other’s social media. It’s been tough for me because the BPD monster wants to tell me he is doing it because he’s hiding something; he’s not. 

That’s not the issue, I’m just giving an example of how this guy has been sticking with me and putting up with my shit, though I’ve been trying not to give him any.

But I’m struggling. I don’t do well in relationships, which is why I’ve stayed away from them. But I really care about him, and vice versa. I can’t shake it out of me, the idea that there’s someone else even though, rationally, there likely isn’t. Why would he stick with me if there were? 

I haven’t seen my therapist in a while, but I will see here in about a week.

How have you guys navigated relationships when your minds wanted to throw all of the doubt and fear at you? Because I am starting to spiral downward hard, and I don’t want to take him (or the rest of my life) with me.

"I love her but it's hard. My GF has Bpd, diagnosed since the age of 14 iirc. She is 21
I tend to depression. I turn 21 this month.

We started dating 10 months ago, my first ever relationship.
Great start, hearts were flying out of our eyes. A couople of existential crisis, fights, and another guy with which she fell in love later, i'm still here with her.
I know she cheated on me with this guy during a bad mood swing that lasted about 2 months.
She doesn't know i do. 
During that period of time she kept getting mad at me, because of the way i act, i speak, because of my lack of genius, and complete distance from arts etc ( that guy painted )

I'm at my first year studying psychology.

I've read in a message to a friend of her that she thought she would have found a love similar to her first.
Now i think she doesn't madly love me like she did before.
I keep telling her that i love her, and that whatever happens i'll be there for her.

I on the other hand have had troubles in bed since the start ( i have hard times...getting it up ).
All the things i listed, plus many other threats because of my inability to have an erection have made it even harder...to achieve.

My friends keep telling me to leave her, that she is just using me, manipulating me. But i care too much for her. I just wish i could also be with her physically. But it's getting harder and harder. 

Now i'm going to her in the city nearby to help her stay focused on her textbooks.

I love her so much, i don't want to lose her, i don't want her to suffer in any way, i always made it clear to her. 

I don't know what i'm searching for, maybe i just wanted to vent out a bit.

So fucking jealous My 2 current best friends are becoming friends with my ex-best friend. I want all 3 of them to fucking die. They hang out with her all of the time now. My hands are shaking with rage just thinking about it right now. I’m so fucking angry. They’re literally ditching me for her and there’s nothing I can fucking do about it but sit and watch it happen because I don’t have any other friends and if I throw a fit they’ll say I’m crazy and manipulative and toxic. If I tell them to stop talking to her they’ll get mad at me for trying to control them and they’ll get even further from me and get even closer to her. And then I won’t have any fucking friends left and then I’ll be alone and she’ll win. I’m having a fucking meltdown and every time they’re with her and every time they talk about her I want to hurt myself bad. I want to hurt myself and I want them to know about it. But I know that’s manipulative. I don’t know what to fucking do and I’m losing my God damn mind. I cry so much and throw a fit by myself in my room every time I see on social media that they’re with her. It makes me hate them so much. I can’t hang out with the 3 of them because my ex-best friend hates me because of how I acted when she was my best friend.

"Guilt &amp; Neg. Feels Hey all,
I was just recently diagnosed with BPD, but I had suspected a couple years ago that I have it. Being diagnosed officially, has given me weird feelings. I'm happy that there is something to put a name to all the crap that goes on in my head, instead of feeling like I'm going crazy (I still think I am going crazy most of the time but you know what I mean), but then I'm also extremely sad and guilty even. 

Which brings me to my question. Does anyone else out there identify as extremely self aware, to the point where you know you are having an emotional outburst that is not necessary? I can see my rational brain trying to calm me down but my irrational side takes over. Once  I am calm again, I feel extreme guilt and self hatred for ""over-reacting"" and then, I spiral again and dive into a self-loathing pit of despair. It's so hard for me to know if my feelings and reactions are ""normal"" (whatever that means), to the point that I am ALWAYS feeling guilty for having ANY negative feelings or reactions, especially with my partner. 

So firstly, does anyone understand my ramble and do the same things? And secondly, How do you know if your feelings are valid or if they are just the BPD rearing it's head? I'm struggling :(","[[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.5302839875221252}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.22495852410793304}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.1537291258573532}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.13485445082187653}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.055907897651195526}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.04939115047454834}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.03077797405421734}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.028177812695503235}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.025160325691103935}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.0208605844527483}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.01950002834200859}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.018300043419003487}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.015298091806471348}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.013878428377211094}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.012701726518571377}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.009943429380655289}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.0070040905848145485}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.0068947263062000275}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.006737585179507732}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.006732726935297251}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.0058245910331606865}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.004835877101868391}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.004470949526876211}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.0032160424161702394}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.003197155660018325}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.0028170752339065075}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.002543365117162466}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.0011386002879589796}]]"
"His indifference is hurting me... For the majority of last year I was his favourite person. We weren't dating but he was like my best friend. I'd hear from him every single day and I'd never feel a burden on his life. He always wanted to talk to me whether he was in a good or bad mood. Even when we were fighting he'd want to talk about everything. His mood changed all the time but no matter what I'd be a huge part of his life and I loved the connection we had. At one point we even talked about dating each other, as I grew to have feelings for him and he often flirted with me or made advances. So I really had high hopes. He's got BPD but he's been in therapy for a while now.

I don't know what happened, but right now I'm just a distant shadow in his life. I've not been split black or devalued...its like he just doesn't find me that important anymore. He rarely texts or calls, and doesn't care to know what's going on with me. Recently we went weeks without speaking just because I decided to wait to see if he'd reach out, but he never did. So I sent him a text yesterday, just asking how he was. He said he was fine and he was the ""same as always"". I told him ""glad to hear, I'm doing well too"". I'm ashamed to say I lied about that. I told him I was trying out new hobbies and making new friends, just because I didn't want him to know the truth (that I'm really depressed and miss his company). He replied ""good for you, hope everything works out for you"", which sounds nice but it made me die a little inside. It felt like something a long distant friend would say. I hoped he'd say something like ""hey its been a while, we need to catch up soon"" but he didn't.

I just don't understand how I went from being the biggest part of his life to an acquaintance. I thought people with BPD split back and white, but I seem to be grey right now, boring old grey. I'm not even important enough for him to split black??  I've never seen him be like this with anyone else in his life. He's either really into someone, or he's been ""abandoned"" by them/painted them black. I feel like I'm broken. Is this normal for people with BPD, and is there a chance he'll come back to being my close friend again?

"My therapist said that i’m slightly dissociating all the time due to my lack of intense emotions. Sometimes emotions aren’t there, sometimes I can’t stop feeling About two months ago I saw my DBT therapist for a private session (couldn’t see my regular therapist due to weather, so I saw DBT therapist to keep being in group), and we talked a little bit about my dissociation. I have Depersonalization/derealization disorder, which comes and goes in intensity, but it pops up a couple times a day. I’ve been dealing with it for almost 4 Years now, and since it first came up it’s not super intense (like a really bad headache that won’t go away even with meds), more like a nagging dull headache that’s not even hurting, just really annoying.

Anyways, she brought up my chronic dissociation, and she asked me how it’s affected my life. I said it kinda hasn’t really, except when I drink or smoke weed, in which case it amplifies a lot and makes me anxious. But when I’m sober it’s not too big of a deal. She then brought up an interesting point and asked when the last time I felt really intense happiness or sadness for an extended period of time. Up until that point. I couldn’t really think of many times where I was spouting emotions for more than a week (I’ve recently gotten better since my depression isn’t intense). She then theorized that it’s possible I’m slightly dissociated all the time due to the fact that I never seem to be super happy or excited. I thought about it, and it made sense.

On the other hand, there’ll be frequent times where I’m super talkative and can’t seem to shut up. I’m loud and excitable, almost to the point of annoyance. Or when I’m not super happy, I’ll get very sullen or angry and hardly talk to anyone, even to people that I normally get annoyingly excitable around.

I feel like this *mayyyy* be a Borderline trait, but Ive always figured that it may be an asocial trait, as it’s determined by who I’m around. Most often I get pumped with emotions whenever I’m around people I really like and enjoy being around—coworkers or my boyfriend, usually.

I dunno really, I just remembered this discussion and just thought I would post here, see if any of you lovely people could relate at all.

As of today, I’m kind of dissociated, not feeling very much of anything despite the fact that I’ve taken my meds.

I just wish i didn’t have these stupid tendencies. I’m sick of this all-or-nothing kind of thing. :/","The expanded size of the tensor (638) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.  Target sizes: [1, 638].  Tensor sizes: [1, 514]"
"Does anybody wish they didn't have empathy? I have a persistent issue where I mistake my hatred for my own empathy for having no empathy. I have plenty of empathy- maybe even too much- and I resent that. I disregard my intuition in hopes that a person or situation will turn out alright and then it doesn't and I end up hating myself for caring too much.

I also avoid forming relationships with people because I don't want to be let down and have to deal with the empathy mess that creates. Although I long for closeness with people, I hate and am afraid of having it.

My life with BPD I have BPD along with other issues. I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia 3 years ago. And it changed me forever. I also have been in recovery from anorexia for about 2 years. So I feel like I'm a complete mess. I used to have friends but at age 28 I only have 2 left. I don't like to go out and socialise. I don't even like going to the store. Since I gained a lot of weight from my recovery I try my best to avoid being in public. I'm just glad I manage work well. I feel like I'm the only one this screwed up that I know. Or I'm at least honest about it. Glad to have found this subreddit.

"Can't shake off the feeling of dread lately I'm sorry, I just want to vent. I want to bail from my current relationship for whatever reason. There's this feeling of... fear? I know I used to split but this doesn't feel like splitting, and it's been days. I think it might even stem from some dream I had some days ago about him leaving somewhere else. I woke up about to cry. Stupid, I know! But it was so vivid and a very likely scenario that it's been on my mind ever since. Why is my brain such a bitch, I don't even know.

Will this, too, pass? He tried reassuring me that he's not going anywhere but then I just feel guilty instead of happy every time I'm with him and it sucks, to say the least. It makes me feel on edge all the time so I've been avoiding talking with him or doing anything that has to do with him.

Me: ""I mean they look too tight. Like your foot is crammed in there tight, fills them up"" (they are cloth vans, so its sorta visible)

I see her ""snap"" and i sense the beginnings of an episode. I suddenly feel a strong desire to end the conversation. 

Her: ""Do you mean they are too long or too narrow?""

me: ""I'm not sure, they just look too tight. I could very well be wrong. If you don't think they are too tight, don't worry about it""

Her (as if she hadnt heard me): ""do you think they are too tight or too narrow?""

Me: ""I have no idea. I really don't know. I just thought they looked too tight. Forget about it""

Her (growing hysteria, we are in public): ""Do they look too tight or too narrow?""

Me (becoming irritated): ""I don't know. Please drop it.""

Her: ""Why won't you just tell me? Are they too tight or too narrow?""

Me: ""I don't fucking know. It was an offhand comment. I don't know if they are too tight or too narrow. I don't want to talk about this. Just drop it.""

Her (starting to talk loudly, shaking and clearly upset. people are all around us): ""James. James. James. Are they too tight or too narrow? James. James.""

Me (getting embarrassed, caught one person staring): ""Mariah, I don't know. Please stop.""

this continues for a few more minutes. Ends with her on verge of tears, low-key yelling, ""why did you do this to me"" ""why are you doing this"" etc.

"Do you romanticize things a lot? Sometimes I feel like I miss the times when I had it the worst or when I was struggling the most.

I had an issue abroad last year. Somebody stabbed me in the back and I got in trouble with immigration for something I never did. This led me to being basically kicked out of the country unless I have certain visas. AKA can't go even for vacation.

Before I left, I was having a shit show of a time. Too focused on how Tinder guys never called me. Issues with a bastard of a FP that led me unable to concentrate on my freelance work because he just strung me around. I was caught up with all things bad happening at the moment. I was broke from not putting in enough hours. I was borrowing more money than I am proud to admit I was. My sense of body image was terrible. I was probably in a position where I needed to go home for a few months to straighten out my mental help and get more help than I was offered there.

It's been about 7 months since I left, and I'm craving that life again. I'm working towards finishing my degree so I can get a job and move there permanently. But part of me knows that when i go back, it's not going to be the same. It's not going to be *fun* anymore. I catch myself thinking that all of the time.

I'm finding myself missing the 3~4 tinder dates a week. I miss getting piss drunk and sleeping around. I miss the late night walks alone in my old neighborhood (which were more like pathetic ""'woe is me' listen to music and remember how shitty my life is"" walks)

All of the sudden I'm so nostalgic of 2014, when I first went abroad for the first time and lived by myself. I listen to these songs that take me back. I remember certain relationships and look back on them with fondness when...they were gross and unhealthy if you really wanted to get technical. Now feels like during those few years the world just stopped and I was just so carefree and happy.

"Recently diagnosed I was diagnosed with BPD a little over a week ago after being mistakenly diagnosed bipolar. The original diagnosis didn’t sit right with me, especially because it was made after one night in the hospital, and based upon the suggestion of my family doctor (obviously not an expert in mental health, although a nice guy). 

After seeing a psychiatrist and getting to know him, he talked to me about BPD and then asked me to look it up on my own. I felt myself relating to what I found and felt his diagnosis was more accurate.

Now I’m navigating the burden of identifying myself as “borderline”. I’m very self conscious of my every action... thinking “am I being borderline? Am I allowed to be mad about this [insert some stressor] or should I just isolate myself and deal with it how I normally would?” 

This is further complicated by my current relationship. We’ve been together 2 years (today is actually our anniversary) with sporadic breaks thrown in. I’m hoping for general advice on processing this diagnosis, navigating self perceptions, and being understanding towards a significant other who I’m quite unstable towards.

"Existentially Stuck in Life Throwaway account because I don't know how this will go. Also, my backstory is an 18 year old white male, not diagnosed but dysfunctional due to at least the symptoms of BPD.

I don't know how to start living my life and I think I can explain why through a few points.

1) Classic BPD symptoms (since I'm not diagnosed I will refrain from using the official label) keep me stuck by own thoughts. Self-hatred, anxiety about doing things, a constant re-evaluation of what I want or don't want. Yada yada.

2) A generational atmosphere of hopelessness about the present job market and future expectancy. Anywhere I look online or otherwise, no one's really excited or positively anxious about what is and what's to come. There seems to be a general consensus that life sucks and will suck. It's hard to avoid, really.

3) No matter where you stand on this stuff, I'm just going to give what it all means to me, not asking for people to agree with me. With things like Feminism and BLM being as prevalent as they seem to be, I keep getting the message that as a white male, I'm not welcome. Seemingly, no matter what I do, I am an oppressor to anyone that's not white or male, consciously or otherwise (unconscious bias and such.)

I'm not looking for sympathy, just wanting to get thoughts out there. I don't think I'm unique in feeling any of this, but I don't see any discussions about people dealing with this combination of things. (BPD symptoms + being 18-20ish + being unwanted by society outright) Does anyone have any thoughts on how to get past, what seems to me to be, a huge mental barrier like this?","[[{'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.261152058839798}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.24406477808952332}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.202650249004364}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.1897449940443039}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.12521570920944214}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.09658975154161453}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.05296209827065468}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.04069275036454201}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.030626174062490463}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.026042524725198746}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.02033989690244198}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.0175645612180233}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.016575230285525322}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.007937152869999409}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.007561061531305313}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.005688209552317858}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.003359846770763397}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.0033505777828395367}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0030148793011903763}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.002658101264387369}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.002437660237774253}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.0021454510278999805}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.0018084085313603282}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.0015506704803556204}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.0013339726720005274}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.0006244563264772296}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.0004429249092936516}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.000320520339300856}]]"

"Periods of lack of empathy from Partner/Mom/Self I feel like an absolute monster, I am disgusted with myself. Does anyone else have periods of lack of empathy I've hurt my partner so much indirectly due to my mess that it's become normal he would cry and I would feel the need to cry with him if he has cried about anything now I just feel extremely uncomfortable with the fact that I have the ability to love but lately as the years pass I don't have that feeling anymore where you feel the hurt other people feel I feel something if I see someone being mistreated on the street but not with my family except for my sister who is really damaged and I worry about her. am I turning into a psychopath? I try hiding the thoughts behind me hoping telling myself it's not true but it's becoming more aparant. 

When my mother cries I just feel numb and I try to respond to how I should be responding and I literally am screaming at myself to feel devasted with her but no matter how hard I beat myself up it doesn't work. I worry about the safety if someone had an attack of some sort but I don't have the feeling to comfort if that makes sense and sometimes I do but by default lately I don't. 

Am I just a psychopath and cold or just empty? I wish I had the ability to just end it I'm an absolute monster, I do things that I don't even want to do or should not be doing even though I literally don't want to and in turn hurts my partner or mother. My mother has very narcissistic traits growing up and she did not allow me to express my feelings properly growing up and defending myself against things I did not do was seen as abusive to her when I was a child. Growing up made me feel extremely insecure and also overly sensitive towards others and myself in compensation for the lack of expression and true emotion I was allowed to express at home growing up so I turned to art and finally longed to be noticed by others for something. 


Did I burn my sensitivity out? Is it possible to develop psychopathy or psychopathic traits. I am very impulsive with checking for mistrust and spending my whole paychecks on things that are for vanity and it makes me feel better and I have to keep doing it. This sounds a bit like narcissism but I actually don't give a shit about myself and I can freely admit I am now a cold person. 

How can I feel again and actually have that spark, I hate that I'm hurting my partner and how impulse I am with spending and doing things that I wouldn't want others to do to me. 

How do you know your a good person, a psychopath or just an evil person?

I need some insight I know this post is all over the place and I'm an absolute mess.

"Depressed and lonely for years, kinda found someone and BPD is preventing me from enjoying it? for a pretty good while I coped with BPD by just shutting everyone out (literally or emotionally) and coped with the resulting isolation with drugs, self harm etc. I got better with therapy &amp; quitting drugs and got the confidence to make a move on a guy I liked, but because I can't believe anyone actually likes me the fact that he really does like me is making me depressed because it makes me really happy that he does seem to like me, and then I read everything as rejection or invent reasons why he doesn't actually like me because no one could etc. Anyone want to share how they got over this?

"Creating problems from nothing I wanted to see if anyone else experienced this sort of thing.

Sometimes I would get really depressed and feel suicidal. I'd tell my boyfriend (ex now) and he'd try to be comforting, or ask whats wrong, or a million other things. In retrospect he went through the entire gamut of possible responses. 

But every time this happened I'd just find a way to say that what he was saying wasn't good enough. I'd blow up on him, tell him I was taking pills, scream/cry/blame. It was basically like I just wanted him to say ""ok kill yourself"" and anything else meant he was shitty.

In our last big fight before I ruined it all and broke up with him, he said that it had reached a point where any time I said I felt like I wanted to die he just started mentally preparing for me to go off on him and not talk to him for the next few days.

I haven't been in a relationship since and I don't know how to stop this.

"Initiating breakup / divorce due to illness? (Possible trigger warning) TL:DR - I have several diagnoses, and my mental health has deteriorated since my hospitalization. I feel my behaviors are adding stress and harm to my husband and our marriage. I’m contemplating on if a separation / divorce would be best for him even though he’s against it. I don’t want to worry and hurt him anymore and feel he’d be better off in the long run.


I apologize for the wall of text ahead of time. A lot has happened. I wasn’t sure which subreddit to post this under, so I thought I’d try here. I’m a 32 year old female. I’ve been with my partner for almost three years. We’ve been married for less than a year.

I’m diagnosed with BPD, self harm tendencies, GAD, alcoholism, and major depressive disorder. There is some agoraphobia mixed in, but that’s not an official diagnosis; I’m just terrified to leave my apartment at times (I can but not without having a panic attack). At this time, I’ve struggled to keep a job outside of the home; I’ve gotten and lost four jobs in the past year due to anxiety and panic attacks at work. My husband knew about my mental conditions, and has been supportive (but is clueless on how to help).

I was hospitalized for two weeks in July of 2017 for self harm and suicidal thoughts, and it has been downhill ever since my discharge. I was denied starting an outpatient DBT program due to (as the hospital psychiatrist put it) our inability to pay out of pocket for treatment (I have no insurance and neither does my husband through his job). I do see a different psychiatrist and take meds (which my husband has to police because I have a history of stopping them). We can’t afford private therapy at this time; my husband brings home enough to cover living expenses and to assist me with some of my bills (like my car payment). My credit is crap at the moment and I genuinely feel bad about not being able to help him financially. We have read books about my conditions to try to get some insight on what we’re dealing with.

Lately I spiral between not wanting him to leave (and SH myself in some way as a result) to lashing out / screaming at him over little things and telling him to leave (only to try to apologize and smooth things over so he won’t leave me).  I’ve gone through episodes of binge drinking when I’m alone to the point where he finds me in the floor and has to take care of me (now we don’t keep alcohol in the house, and he takes my keys with him). Yesterday was the boiling point; I was upset about a call from a creditor and made a suicide threat as a way of taking care of it all within earshot of him. I have had ideations often for the past eight months, but I never plan to act on it (too cowardly, and I don’t want to hurt him or my family). He gets upset at my statement and tries to reason with me, and I screamed at him repeatedly until he stopped talking. He went into the other room for a while and came back later to talk. He called me out as using that as a manipulative tactic and that it hurt him to hear me say that. I broke down crying because I felt it was true; I didn’t really want to die, but I want some relief from the stress and said something that’d get his attention. He contemplated taking me back to the hospital, but ended up scheduling an emergency appointment with my psychiatrist this coming week and having a ‘babysitter’ (family friend or his mother) stay with me while he’s at work. He still tells me he loves me, but I notice he’s more on high alert now. I should have just gone back to the hospital, but I was being difficult and was refusing to go with him, and he got exasperated with fighting me over it and set up plan B.

I feel like a POS about everything (and I know I deserve any negative comments I will receive from this post). I know what I’m capable of acting like, but I don’t know how to control it; it’s like I go into a rage for a while, then realize “oh that may have hurt him” only after the damage is done. I’ve read in another subreddit stories about other people with partners and spouses with BPD...and they never seem to end well. I’ve mentioned to him the possibility of a separation or divorce so he can get away from me (even though I don’t want him to leave). He refuses saying he loves me and staying with me no matter what. I just worry about how I’m affecting him and his mental health with my behaviors.

I love him, but I believe he deserves better than this. I don’t think he’s realized he’s signed up for this for a lifetime. I don’t want to lose him, but I don’t want him to suffer.","The expanded size of the tensor (1122) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.  Target sizes: [1, 1122].

"DAE feel awful without admiration? I know this might sound like NPD, as opposed to BPD, but does anyone else feel bad/sick/awful when they aren't admired or appreciated?

I'll give you some reference, I am an artist, a musician mainly and I promote myself a lot and do get credit, but when someone else comes in and shares their creations and gets credit, it makes me feel awful as I believe I deserve that admiration, but I'm not the vengeful type, I will give them props as well but I will always try to best them later somehow.

"The never-ending abandonment A few days before yesterday, life was being really kind to me — I finally felt brave enough to message friends when in need of attention despite worrying they were going to think of me as horribly clingy, I could focus during class, and I didn’t feel suicidal more than once or twice. For the first time in what seemed like forever, my feelings of emptiness and anxiety had given way to what I suppose would be most closely described as content. 

Then yesterday, I asked what (at least according to snapchat lol) could be considered one of my closest friends if she felt like hanging out after class. She declined, explaining she planned to spend the weekend finishing some assignments due next week. I really tried not to overreact but I couldn’t help but feel as if someone had stabbed me in the chest :/ 

Anyway, fast forward a few hours. I’m looking at the snapchat story of a mutual friend. She’s posted a video from a party she’s currently at. And whom do I see in the background but someone who’s the exact same height, with the exact same hair colour, as my oh-so-busy friend? I couldn’t tell for sure due to the bad quality, and I’ve never heard of her going to a party before (her parents are overly protective and won’t let her anywhere near alcohol as long as she lives at home), but the prospect of it MIGHT being her pushed me back into this deep pit of despair. I’m devastated she might have lied to me. I’m ashamed to tears thinking about how it’s my own fault for pushing her away by being too clingy, for making a wrong assumption when I thought she wouldn’t hate me if kept messaging her all the time. 

I hate always making others abandon me. I hate feeling like the world has ended whenever it happens. And I hate her. How could she do this to me? Why couldn’t she just grow some backbone and tell the truth? 

Anyway, I’m sorry for this gloomy vent but I’ve spent the whole day in bed too hurt to do anything (besides deleting snapchat hah) and now I feel more empty than ever :(","[[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.607314944267273}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.27303436398506165}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.10487893968820572}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.07640838623046875}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.05494917556643486}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.045476965606212616}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.03560736030340195}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.034510936588048935}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.033024732023477554}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.0309015903621912}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.026952043175697327}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.02377053163945675}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.01654314249753952}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.01332175638526678}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.011782794259488583}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.010007966309785843}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.008016088046133518}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.006443625781685114}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.006019677501171827}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.003910270519554615}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.003785871434956789}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.003665811847895384}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.00365072232671082}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.002825744217261672}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.0023332948330789804}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.002101810183376074}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.000573827710468322}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.0004954891628585756}]]"
"Skipping Therapy So I’ve kind of decided to skip therapy.

"If I do have BPD, could this be related? Hey guys, 
I don't have a BPD diagnosis but I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety a few years ago but I know I withheld a lotttt of info from my psychiatrist. Id honestly never considered the possibility of having bpd until recently when I discovered that my mother and multiple other family members suffer with it (although honestly the only reason I'd never noticed it in them is because I was fairly ignorant as far as symptoms of bpd go)  but after looking into it a lot it seemed eerily accurate. I'm not going to go into detail about all my symptoms here as I am not looking for a diagnosis, nor am I going to sit here and pretend that the internet qualifies as an official means of such. I do plan on going to the dr at some point about this whole thing.
Now I know that 'splitting' and such are often pretty big indicators of bpd, but i don't think this is an area I can relate to. However, there are some things that I wonder if they could possibly be atypical manifestations of or related to splitting. Only after thinking back to my childhood pretty deeply (I struggle to remember a great deal of my childhood for unknown reasons) did I realise that the friendships I made with people were very up-and-down. I'd be 'best friends' with someone and genuinely feel that way about them then go home and think about how much they irritated me and pull away from them, only to realise that as soon as they were gone I desperately wanted to be close to them again. I've actually realised I still do this now where I go through phases of wanting to be super close with someone then finding them to be overwhelming annoying and noticing every tiny little thing they do that irritates me and say nasty things behind their back and avoid them, until they eventually distance themselves and I realise that I want them back. I don't want to treat people like this but I can't seem to help it :/ There are a couple of people though who I unwaveringly want to be close with.
The other thing that I am unsure of being considered splitting is the way I am with people I'm interested in/are interested in me. I've never been in a real relationship so I find answering questions regarding that area of symptoms to be quite challenging. Despite the fact that I crave being in a relationship and fantasise about falling in love and finding my soul mate etc, and wanting people to be attracted to me  and such, I end up doing the same thing every time. I think I like someone and for a few days/weeks I think about them non-stop, imaging unrealistically perfect scenarios in my head of the 2 of us, and then when they show interest in return I thrive on the attention for a few days/weeks, before suddenly becoming very uncomfortable spending time with them to the point where alone time with them makes me squeamish and anxious but I have literally no idea why. And then I ghost them and then I hate myself for fucking up what I always believe to have been my last chance of having anything good happen ever. (And then of course every now and again I'll start to fall for someone again as soon as they've moved on because of course that's how life happens right)
Sorry this is really wrong and rambley but what do you guys think? Does this sound like it could be related to BPD?

"BPD and relationships I (F19) have had many high school partners in the past, and due to my jealousy/insecurities I have completely pushed all of my previous boyfriends away (e.g. I will create scenarios in my head, believe it completely then hate my partner for whatever reason it is that my silly mind has made up). 
I am currently dating this wonderful turkish man (27) whom I met through my boss ('tis his nephew), and we have so far had absolutely no issues. I trust him completely, I can see a future and I really do feel like he is the one. But i'm scared that I will fall back into my same patterns and either push him away, or eventually get sick of him (as I did with majority of my exes). 
Does anybody have ANY advice on what I can do to maintain the contentment and love we have for each other? I know he probably won't change the way he feels towards me, but i'm terrified I will.

"Uni Hi

I am diagnosed. My emotions are erratic as in I feel a mental breakdown is ensuing. 

I have a uni exam in two days. I have not studied because I've been stuck in a low depression and low motivation and I have difficulty maintaining concentration and focus which I'm sure a lot of you can relate to.

I cannot defer this exam as it is already deferred and to add salt to the wound this is the second time I am attempting this unit as the first time was the same situation: I deferred the initial exam and then didn't sit the deferred one because of major depression. 

The uni doesn't care. Extra time (ie deferment) does shit all for me; I still have to suffer the same struggles as any other exam. There is actually no targeted assistance for people with depression and who have trouble engaging in mass-content study. I complete all my coursework no worries and ask for little, if any, extensions and I get decent grades but my brain cannot handle the type of learning/memorisation for an exam. 

Anyway, I was perusing come posts on here yesterday and a person stated that their psychiatrist suggested they should engage in study so that they don't feel their life is all about therapy. My psychiatrist is the exact opposite! She says that it's torture for someone to manage BPD whilst studying and wants me to drop out completely (not happening). She doesn't care that doing uni is a dream of mine and important to me and that I want an education and I feel like she is metaphorically sitting me down and giving me the 'it's nice you want to try but you just can't do it' spiel. 

After reading this person's post it just made me wonder what if the difference between pursuing your goals or not relied upon whether your psychiatrist supported you? I totally get that my psych is trying to say 'hey, your suffering is huge, you don't need the extra burden of something like uni, why not take care of yourself first'. I get that. But I also feel like she thinks I'm a big joke for thinking I can do uni (I am capable of it) but just can't say it with those words. I hate asking for medical certificates for deferred exams because I feel like I'm proving her right in that I can't do it but each time an exam rolls around she gives the 'let me know if you need me to write you a certificate' which I can only take as support in that I am worthy of medical exemption. 

Logic has it that I shouldn't sit my exam (yet again) but with that comes not completing the unit again and I will have to repeat it a third time. I am constantly in talks with the special needs entity about my provisions not helping me but they don't care; any other assistance provided to me would (in their eyes) deviate too far from what is 'fair' to other students. 

Someone please help I am feeling so useless and a failure. What's more, my psychiatrist downplays the value (or the value as I see it) of deferring, saying it's 'just paperwork' for the uni and that it's no big deal (as I always catastrophise and say that the uni thinks I'm a joke).

"Road to Somewhere Hey everyone.  
  
Long time lurker, first time poster here in /r/BPD. I created a throwaway account for privacy reasons.  
  
I was diagnosed with BPD in late spring/summer of last year. I was previously diagnosed with depression and anxiety as a result of my first 5150 in February of 2015. After another inpatient hospitalization in May 2015 and subsequent partial hospitalizations plus intensive therapy, I started to realize that I was more than just depressed. I thought it was just my codependency but that didn’t explain how I went from bliss to rage in a split second. At first I thought I was bipolar, like my mother. But the duration of my depressive episodes vs. what I originally mistook as mania didn’t align with the diagnostic criteria.  
  
I was relieved to get a diagnosis that made sense. But soon after, I was consumed by dread and fear. I can count the number of meaningful and important relationships in my life in one hand. I am estranged from my entire family so I really only have my boyfriend and 3 friends. A key defining characteristic of our disorder is not being able to have stable relationships, so the thought of losing my chosen family as a result of BPD after having already lost my blood-related family is frightening to say the least.  
  
I tried my best to channel that fear into motivation to get help. I was and still am willing to do everything it takes to preserve my relationships. But man, has it been difficult. After some struggles with my health insurance, I abruptly ceased all types of BPD treatment in the fall of last year. Quitting Lamictal and Abilify cold turkey kicked my ass and so did the lack of Ativan or Xanax. All I had left were the few skills I learned from a DBT class I was enrolled in and weekly CoDA meeting at my local community center.  
  
Needless to say, I got really bad. I can no longer control my self-harm impulses or my emotional outbursts that usually manifest in rage and violence. My boyfriend has suffered the brunt of all of this since we live together. I am so ashamed and upset in admitting that he’s been my punching bag and is actually scared of me. My relationship is on thin ice and he gave me an ultimatum last November of either getting help or parting ways. At the time, I still didn’t have insurance and wouldn’t be covered until the start of the new year. I thought it would be challenging but feasible to keep it together till present day, but then Christmas said hold my ~~beer~~ eggnog, along with many other triggers, and I lost it several times since, most recently this past Monday where I cracked the wood of the locked door of the guest room in my house with a series of headbutts and punches because my boyfriend was in there needing his very-well-deserved space away from me. Despite his ultimatum, he’s still around. I want to believe that it’s because he’s hopeful in my recovery and because he genuinely loves me; I don't want to believe the million other bad thoughts I have plaguing my mind of why he’s still around.  
  
With a bruised hand and forehead, plus other hidden damage, I will be seeing a psychiatrist again this upcoming Tuesday. I am excited and terrified about it. I want to get better, I really do. I don’t want suicide to be my plan B, shit I don’t even want it to be my plan Z, I don’t want to consider it as an alternative solution anymore! Although the thought of being emotionally and mentally stable seem like a dream, I think it’s something worth dreaming of until it becomes a reality. Will it though? I don’t know. Has my fire been extinguished or has it been reduced to a barely-palpable smoldering? I don’t know either. But I want to find out.

"A question on supportive relationships Hey. I'm currently in therapy, diagnosed with C-PTSD, DD and BPD. I'm male.

Since starting therapy, I started cutting people out of my life where I realized I didn't even like them. My dissociations covered that all up, it's why I didn't notice earlier.

Anyway, I've also met a girl online who has severe trauma and BPD as well. We have not yet met but we have been chatting on a daily basis for 2 months and I trust her 100%. I feel like she is the only and first person I can trust in my life. 

Now the question is: Is this healthy? What if we meet and our BPD makes it all worse? What if she gets abandonment issues and makes my life even worse than it already is? Do you think something like this can work? 

She has been there for me in bad times. I don't want to lose the first and only person I trust 100%. And just stopping texting her feels harsh. 

What would you say? If you were this girl, do you think it would be a good idea for me?

**Edit**: I was talking about a bond, not an actual relationship.","[[{'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.27120348811149597}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.18978223204612732}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.13610388338565826}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.13275212049484253}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.11843835562467575}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.09540051966905594}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.07024655491113663}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.06467914581298828}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.06339425593614578}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.05194399133324623}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.04381905496120453}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.03720811381936073}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.02727515622973442}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.013423644006252289}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.013275316916406155}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.010923491790890694}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.008346648886799812}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.006621712818741798}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.0053404844366014}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.004784177523106337}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.00457925396040082}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.004464707337319851}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.0037297371309250593}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.0026881811209023}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.002199804410338402}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.000774426618590951}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.0006727178697474301}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.0001975220366148278}]]"

I graduated a couple of years ago, I left a really good job I worked so hard to get because of this fucking disorder. I have very few friends. I can go weeks and weeks without seeing anyone but my mother (who also has BPD). It feels like I have so much to give but I have no one to give it to. 

I hate myself so much that I won't go and join local groups. I think I'm disgusting so no one will want to talk to me and I can't deal with that rejection.

"Flashbacks/Intrusive thoughts Background: I've had BPD since I was 9 or 10 years old, but only started therapy last summer (at 25). I had a devastating bipolar II/mixed-episode breakdown in September - early October that left me hospitalized and actively suicidal, and was the culmination of several years' trauma and self-neglect. 

Since then, I've figured out medication, resumed regular therapy, gotten a great job, and more or less stabilized. I reconnected with my partner, fell in love with what I do professionally and my team at work, started mending my family relationships, and have generally felt *good* about myself. I can't overstate how well-functioning Current-Me is compared to Recently-Past-Me.

But what's been terrifying lately, is that I've had more and more vivid flashbacks and lucid dreams that drag me back into spirals I've gone down anytime in the past 5-6 years. I've been blindsided by a smell, word/phrase, or even texture (on a fabric or a certain food) that triggers a flight into what I think is probably c-ptsd. 

I've also had a huge uptick in intrusive thoughts. Over the last few weeks, I seem to have lost my ability to mindfully shut them down or hear them without verbalizing.

My best guess at what's going on is an analogy to what usually triggers migraines for me - I'm responding to some delayed ""release of stress."" But does anyone have a better explanation? I feel like whatever's going on is chipping away at the ""progress"" I've made recently, and might undermine what I've achieved.

"About Temporary Isolation I'm seeking professional help for my BPD and decided to eliminate contact with people with whom I have an unhealthy relationship until I get at least a little better at this. As you probably guessed, those are also my favorite people and the reason we have an unhealthy relationship is mostly my fault for idolizing them, romanticizing the friendship and expecting too much. The isolation makes my daily life much easier and less dramatic, but it has a predictable disadvantage: they haven't contacted me since I stopped contacting them and that makes me feel unloved.

"What helps you control bad thoughts? Sometimes something, or a combination of lots of little somethings, triggers an unstoppable flood of incredibly dark/self-deprecating thoughts that I can't seem to cope with. This leads me to act out in drastic ways: i.e. having a meltdown, self-harming, saying awful shit to people who don't deserve it, basically seeking validation or attention in any way possible, even if it's negative. 


What helps you calm these thoughts? What helps you have some semblance of control over your reactions to such thoughts? 


For me, writing them all down helps immensely, and gives me something physical to focus on other than just retreating into my head, or worse.

"Tips on practicing healthy habits and mindfulness in relationships? I have a long history of rocky relationships/friendships. I’m in my early 20s but have either removed myself or been ejected from five different friend groups in the last ten years. I only have one remaining friend who has known me for over two years and they are an exceedingly kind and patient and understanding person. However, I can’t even say that I particularly enjoy our time spent together despite how much they mean to me. I feel terrible. 

I feel lonely and miserable. I’m currently part of a friend group I really enjoy but I’m terrified to get any closer to any of them than I already am. I feel like I have no control over my future even though I know that’s impossible. Every potential friendship feels like there is an inevitable and terrible end. 

In my last friend group, these feelings caused me to close myself off and only speak to others in large group settings. I wound up feeling jealous and hurt when I noticed that people within the group formed close-knit friendships and I felt like an obnoxious, annoying outsider. I entirely closed myself off after that and broke all contact. I know it’s a bad and thoughtless move. I was so convinced at the time that no one would care anyway that I didn’t consider that maybe someone actually would 

Sorry this is long-winded and rambling. I’ve never talked about this before. 

I’ve thought a lot about the similarities and differences in what caused each relationship to ultimately fail. I want to be able to change that by learning from the past. However, each situation is muddled and complicated in my brain. I just know that the common denominator is me; I know that I am the problem. I just really have no idea where to begin or what to do.

My question is does anyone have any general advice for me? Particularly in mindfulness and frame of mind? I’m tired of feeling like my life isn’t mine to live and more so I’m sick to my stomach over hurting and making everyone I’ve ever cared about hate me in the end

"had a sleepover with my fp. it was pretty alright, but there were a few things that happened that were upsetting. my fp has a super controlling girlfriend, and there were two times when she facetimed him, and they texted the entire night. there was even a time when she got drunk and craved his attention, and so he ended up telling her that he misses her and said he couldn’t be with her. he almost texted her that he wishes he could be with her but i think he avoided saying that bc i was kinda reading what he was saying (he’s fine w it). it was really upsetting to know that i couldn’t even spend quality time with him when we were alone and i can’t spend time with him a lot bc his gf never lets him spend time alone. i think he could tell that i was upset though bc everytime he texted her he would snuggle me or be affectionate with me. i loved spending time with him but it didn’t feel good enough.

"Hey guys. My girlfriend has BPD. I don't know whether I'm allowed to post here or not. If not, then feel free to delete my post. I completely understand. 

It seems like you guys are quite open about BPD, something that my ex isn't, and I have alot of questions that I don't understand. I wanna make this relationship work, but it's hard. 

First of all I gave her all the reassurance in the world. I blocked multiple girls on social media. I'm not talking to any girls. I don't go out to drink, cause I know it would hurt her. 

The thing is, even though I'm completely sacrificing myself she still is so angry sometimes. She hits me without a reason, or for a reason that I don't seem to understand. She always feels criticized, even though I'm not really critizising her at all. She lied to me about things that are undeniable, still she tried to convince me that it is not true. 

Sometimes I feel like I'm talking to a wall. She only sees her point of view, and she doesn't know how her behaviour is affecting me. We've been through multiple breakups now, but she always ended up texting me again, promising me to change, but she never did. Everytime she had me back, she became cold again. I felt like a third degree person. 

Whenever we fight she just vanishes, either she runs out of the house, storms out of the car, or goes to sleep when it's a text fight. Leaving me in the chaos and confusion. The next day she acts like nothing happened. It doesn't work for me. I wanna solve these problems, but we can't solve problems if she always leaves whenever it comes to confrontation. Why can't she admit to her flaws? Why is it that she can be so nice one second, and in the other one she is so cold?

I treated her like a goddess, I gave her everything she wanted, I took care of her when she was feeling bad. After all she said that I'm the most interesting guy she ever met. So why does she seem so uninterested ? Whenever she did something wrong, i.e. flirting with another guy, and I found out about it she grabs a knife and helds it on her wrist, which immediately makes me forgive her.

How can she do all these things to me ? After all it was her that was always afraid of me cheating on her. 
She said that she is doing a good thing by threatening suicide, cause she is trying to keep us together with it.
She also said that I'm the one who made her like this. It's not fair at all. 

Can you guys give me some insight ? I wanna be able to get her into therapy, even though I know that I'll probably never will.

Thank you and have a good day!

edit: I wrote her a very long letter, explaining that I will support her with everything I got, if she decides to go to therapy.

"How do you learn to trust someone/accept that their intentions are good? I was diagnosed just a few months ago. I'm trying different, natural ways to help me mentally before I resort to meds. I have a boyfriend of 7 months who's been extremely supportive, loving and patient. He tells me how much he loves me all the time. I only get to see him once a week but we've discussed moving in together within the next few months. 

It's just so so so hard for me to accept that he truly does love me. I've been cheated on and used by so many guys in the past that I rarely let anyone in anymore. I come from being raised by an abusive, unloving mother. I have little friends because people are just so cruel. How do I learn to fully trust that his intentions are always good and all these rotten thoughts I have that he's out cheating on me are just tricks my mind is playing. We just spent two days together and he left and he hasn't texted me in two hours and I instantly assume that he must be out with someone else. It's awful that I'm always in panic mode. I'd do anything to just calm down and accept that he doesn't want to hurt me but my brain doesn't allow that.

"Was I ever a Favourite Person? I know two people diagnosed with BPD and I'm still learning about all the terms. One of them is a guy I became very close with last year, but I'm not actually sure if I was ever his FP. Can someone enlighten me?

When we first met, he was keen on getting to know all about me. He was in a long-term relationship but he constantly talked about how toxic she was and how she'd cheated on him and how their relationship was breaking down (guessing this is what they call splitting black?). Then he began to pursue me romantically and he'd come on very strong, kissing me etc. Whenever his girlfriend called him, he'd tell her he was with me and he'd try and make her jealous.

Eventually, she broke up with him, leaving him for someone else. He was devastated, which really surprised me. He begged for her forgiveness and became depressed for many weeks. He even apologised to me for his past behaviours, saying he just didn't know how to control his impulses. I was pretty mad at him for a while, but somehow we ended up becoming close friends.

He got diagnosed at this point and began to confide in me about his fears, talking about his feelings with me until 3am. This went on for a solid few months and we'd meet up all the time and hang out together. He'd always call me up asking what I was doing, if I wanted to meet him. Occasionally, I'd see the other side to him where he'd get snappy or he'd say something belittling to me. He'd constantly give me mixed messages about how he felt about me. One minute he was trying to make me jealous by talking about other girls in front of me, and the next minute he was back to flirting with me, hinting he wanted more. Then at one point he had a major rage at me, saying how he was upset because I'd made some comment he took offense to. Afterwards he calmed down, saying he only got made because he had feelings for me but that we couldn't possibly be together because I clearly didn't trust him blah blah...but he'd still always stay in touch and it was clear I was the only regular person in his life.

Anyway, that was several months ago. Over the past few months, he's become increasingly distant from me to the point he now hasn't been in touch with me for weeks. It feels so strange to go from being so close, to barely speaking. I decided to text him the other day to ask how he was. He replied straight away saying he was fine, but he didn't carry the conversation on and he ended it with ""hope everything goes well for you, keep on keeping on"" which sounded so final. It doesn't feel like I've been split black, just kind of forgotten about and that hurts. I know he's gotten a new job and some new hobbies and he's busy with new friends. I wouldn't doubt he has new romantic interests because I've seen him talking to other girls on Facebook etc.

I'm just wondering, was I ever his FP? Or was I just someone he used to get back at his girlfriend, then someone he used for emotional support until he got back on his feet? How can he just distance himself from me and become indifferent after being so close?","The expanded size of the tensor (703) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.

"I need some support my boyfriend broke up with me today. he told me he needs to focus more on himself, and that we have grown apart from each other and he maybe wasn't ready to start dating when we did. we were together for almost 6 months. 
given I've taken almost a year of DBT, I've learned that yes, it's okay to need space and focus on yourself. he said he still loves me a lot and I'm really important to him, but he felt like it could get toxic between us. 
what I need some support in, is just radically accepting this reality as it is. I don't know why, but it seems really common for BPD people to love so hard, it ends up putting a strain on their relationships. he told me he feels like I'm a bit bossy and I  consumed a lot of his time.  I did not ask for him to dote on me like he did, to put all his concern into me.

"Brain scans of burn victims playing VR games show substantially less pain in related brain areas, proposed to be due to ""dissociation the user feels from their body and the regular release of endorphins during the game"". [Link to the study](https://www.hitl.washington.edu/projects/vrpain/).

First of all, though this is for burn victims, doesn't BPD basically make you an ""emotional burn victim?"" 

Dissociation is something that we commonly do as a defense mechanism, and endorphins we achieve by cutting ourselves or doing drugs.

"Redditors with BPD and bipolar disorder: does BPD ever come and go (with some moods)? Hello there, visitor from the bipolar side of things.  I'm wondering about what it's like to be bipolar and have BPD.

I've been reading through the DSM and I feel like I resonate with a lot of the symptoms listed there on BPD, but as far as I can remember, I only seem to feel that way during longer depressive episodes and during the winter (or maybe under high stress, i.e. school?).  When I'm stable, I don't remember struggling with the symptoms in the DSM.

So my question is-- is BPD something that is always there?  Or is it something that might only occur during some depressive episodes?

"5 am ramblings I honestly don’t know if I have BPD, but I have so many of the signs. I think my Mom had it, she’s been gone almost 5 years. I know my family has issues sadly most of them have passed away now. I am left only to speculate. 

I have a doctors appointment tomorrow and I am trying to work up the courage to talk to my doctor about my mental health. Which I feel has been at a all time low since June of last year. Longer than 6 months I have been in what I describe as the “bell jar.” 

I have really opened myself up and tried to be honest with me for a change. I have had a lot of memories that flooded back to me. I have realized how unhealthy my family dynamic was. I suspect Narcissism, BPD, enabling, gaslighting and crazy making were all involved my family. I have also been in a relationship/marriage with a narc for 12 years before I got the guts to leave him. Then immediately got involved with a psychopath. ( there was a definitive difference in them, yet so many similarities)

These are the reasons I think I’m BPD. 
-I get super bored in relationships 
-I have been very promiscuous in the past 
-pick fights with people to see if they’ll stay
-I have had a fear of abandonment since I was a child 
-I have a hard time maintaining friendships 
- I am 36 and have never felt like I could take care of myself 
-I have guilt as almost my first emotion about everything in my life
-I rage which embarrasses me to even type that 
- I experienced severe disassociation after I left my ex husband. I remember for almost 6 months, I walked around just thinking this is not my life. It was like watching a movie on a screen and I was on auto pilot 

There are more things I could list on here but I think it gives anyone who would read this a little of an idea of how I feel. 

In the past I have been diagnosed with PTSD and GAD. After I left my ex husband, I was trying so hard to act normal I went off my meds. For about two years, I lived completely unmedicated and not admitting I had a problem to anyone. That puts me back to around June of this year when I kinda unraveled. 

Thanks for reading this. These are my crazy thoughts I have to share because I cannot sleep through the night ( even with ambien which makes me do some crazy stuff). 😊","The expanded size of the tensor (560) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.

"How to recover from a mentally abusive relationship? My last girlfriend was honesty such a bully. I basically spent the whole last half of the relationship afraid of her leaving because she would treat me like shit and tell me I’m not good enough. It ended when I found out she cheated a month before, and I’m sure anyone with bpd can relate to this but i fucking hate the bitch now. 

She tries EVERYTHING to make me jealous or angry. I actually refuse to show up to any party she goes to and look on snapchat to see if she will show up before I go out because last time I went to one and she was there, she grabbed a bunch of dudes (not very cool dudes either) hands and went into the woods with them as soon as she saw me. Not only did this piss me off, i couldn’t talk to anyone else at the party because I was drenched in sweat from the constant emotional pain and could not carry on a conversation, then I got my friends to leave and I just started punching and breaking shit because I was drunk, my bedroom door is absolutely destroyed because I punched a hole right through it. I have been messaging countless amounts of girls in an effort to get back at her and get over her.

She’s a VERY gorgeous girl to be honest I would give her an 8.5/10 and I just can not believe how far she would go to fuck with my head, she will sacrifice every bit of dignity she has to fuck with me, it even hurts me to see her degrade herself. One of these days I am going to lose it, She really has the potential to ruin my life because I loved her so much if any guy was to join her side and provoke me by talking trash or starting a fight, they would die. Right then and there, and I’m not joking either.

This is probably the lowest I’ve felt in my life, Everything reminds me of her, and I’ve been so depressed that my heart hurts nearly every second I’m awake, Usually when I’m depressed I will either smoke a joint or lift weights, but this is different and none of its working. I try not to show my emotions and have been ignoring her and making only small talk since we broke up, she really thinks I don’t care about her anymore tbh, but that’s only my attempt to get over her. It’s like a bad drug addiction. Someone help me please because all this is seriously killing me on the inside, I am in soo much pain.

Tl;dr My ex who cheated constantly tries to make me jealous and will go great lengths to fuck with my head, trying to ignore her and forget about her but its not working at all. Never felt so much emotional pain in my life.

Update: I finally managed to get a girl as pretty (if not prettier) than her. Well guess what, she seen her on snapchat map at my house and messaged me, threatening to come over and fight us with her idiot friends, and tried to destroy my self esteem by telling me all the mean shit people say behind my back. I am beyond pissed and am considering getting a restraining order against her. I had to lie and tell her we left. Then she went and got with this girls ex boyfriend and sent me a bunch of pictures of her panties in his room to make me jealous. God I fucking hate this shit, Needless to say I flew into her and called her and said the meanest possible stuff my brain could muster. I have her blocked now but I’m sure that isn’t going to stop her ffs!!","The expanded size of the tensor (773) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.

"I wish I could stop feeling I can't bring myself to explain the entire situation. It's too much, this long saga of instances where I should have acted/reacted differently; should have done/not done things; should have opened my eyes to reality instead of using the old standby of ""do unto others..."" when really I was just turning away from what I didn't want to see. 

Not to use it as an excuse but my classic BPD symptoms took hold and I desperately want to use them to numb the pain of my heart being ripped from my body; numb the shame of allowing myself to be used, for crossing so many lines; numb the anger of allowing a lying, lazy, manipulating man into my home, my heart, the hearts of my children; the anger at not protecting them from someone who used their love of him against us all; the anger at relying on someone else.

I want it to stop. To fuck it away. To drink it away. To smoke it away, eat it away, shop it away. Anything to make it go away.

I hate this.","[[{'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.3459637463092804}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.30393797159194946}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.2056014984846115}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.12270573526620865}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.0788380578160286}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.07485441863536835}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.07363586127758026}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.03993912413716316}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.011857460252940655}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.011564251966774464}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.011500796303153038}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.011363176628947258}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.0067704240791499615}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.005604901816695929}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.005514561664313078}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.005407074466347694}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.005128039978444576}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.0047452314756810665}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.00421785656362772}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.0033772927708923817}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.0022947732359170914}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.0021744531113654375}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.00167843175586313}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0016105842078104615}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.0012753838673233986}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.0011548706097528338}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.0011227454524487257}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.0010548055870458484}]]"

"Wanting to have a baby...but afraid. My husband and I have been married for almost 7 years now. He has a daughter who is 8 and I've been raising her alongside him. I've never been pregnant, and I'm worried about my moods....I was diagnosed as Bipolar for 10 years before seeing a specialist who just diagnosed me with BPD. It's more believable to me as well. But I've had to go through a lot of medicine changes. Since getting off of lithium and Lexapro for zoloft I feel more stable, but I'm still worried about the depression and suicidal thoughts I have. 
I'm scared to know how I'll be while pregnant. I get really pissy if I'm tired and I trigger myself a lot. I really want a baby, and so does my husband. And I'm just curious if anyone has been pregnant with bpd and how you held up. My husband is extremely supportive and understanding. He does everything he can for me, and pays attention to every detail. I'm just worried about myself....I can't find much on BPD and planned pregnancies...just...""accidentally getting pregnant"" because of BPD...

Edit: I'm not here for judgment. I'm asking if anyone has been pregnant and how they coped. I do not need someone to tell me I shouldn't have a child when I want one.

My mom has been wanted me to help her with things. She has been homeless for the past year and staying in garages and hotels. My mom found a place and so fam has to deal with storages and moving
 
I talked to my gf everyday I have been gone and reassure her I loved her, missed her and wanted to be there so bad. I kept her updated and try to make her understand the situation. I have been at my fams for 3 weeks and she said she has been questioning our relationship since I had been gone so long. Right afterwards she had her ex gf who she calls her friend over and they drink and she cheated on me. She did tell me shortly after and said she was sorry but she then has proceeded to just blame me. Saying she wouldn't have done it if I would have been there and she was lonely. Said I abandoned her and she needed to feel someone's embrace. She clearly has issues with abandonment and attachment. 

How should I go about dealing with someone who shows signs of bpd that's cheated on me?","[[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.7669472098350525}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.12359604239463806}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.10626460611820221}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.09479359537363052}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.07754145562648773}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.06764420121908188}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.04710662364959717}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.02926446869969368}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.028987616300582886}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.02782808616757393}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.02355710044503212}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.01800587773323059}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.01578993909060955}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.015745937824249268}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.010370471514761448}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.009572582319378853}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.007937520742416382}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.007877899333834648}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.004100910387933254}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.003940417896956205}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.00313350697979331}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.0029289633966982365}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.002744752913713455}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0023155559320002794}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.0016071215504780412}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.0012144476640969515}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.0007108749123290181}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.000508882338181138}]]"

Should I do this? Ex has all the waif BPD traits but lives in a country where almost no one knows what that is. She knows she has issues but has no clue what's wrong with her. Found a very good article that explains it quite well in her own language.

"Creating a DBT support group Hi everyone, 

So my tiny town only has one DBT group and they always have a waiting list. The other option is a hospital regulated group, but their next course isn’t until next winter!  

I’m not a DBT trainer or a therapist, I just have taken a DBT group course before. I really work better when I have to practice accountability, so groups are ideal.... I just can’t seem to make it happen here. 

I was looking into creating a sort of DBT support group. If I started such a group it’d be similar to say, a French language practice club or a cooking meet up. It would be free, take place in a church or classroom or something, people would bring their own books (or I could maybe make copies). There would be a skill and worksheet every week we’d practice and go over. I’d cap it at maybe 10? People. Maybe there’d be something to sign confirming that I’m not an expert, etc. 

Now, is this a terrible idea? What are some issues I should be aware of? Would any of you, if this happened in your city, be interested?

I feel like it answers a lot though. The splitting is very real and really extreme.

I feel incredibly hopeless and unloveable. I only have myself to blame for the heartache. Can’t even begin to imagine how they feel.

"Just discovered this sub earlier today I'm done with using throwaways on reddit, I don't care anymore.

I just discovered this subreddit as of today.

I am not yet diagnosed, but plenty of people have been suggesting me to do so. So, monday, I finally will.

But I'm pretty sure I already know the answer. I have known it for years. But I just always pushed it aside. ""Nah, it's just social anxiety"" or something like that. But now that I have read a lot of posts here, I feel home. I feel part of a group.

But it's been rough, haven't eaten properly in 2 days, I can't hold a conversation anymore. I go to college but I'm just 'not there'. I haven't really been there for a long time, in mental form. But since a few days, it just got so much worse. There's someone out there who I like a lot and still talk to, but I know I can't handle a relationship. Especially not now. And it's driving me nuts. I want to talk to her all day but it's either non-sense, short answers, me complaining about life, or utter silence. And ofcourse the feeling that she hates me and is against me kicks in every time, too.

But the worst part is, I don't actually want the answer. I don't want to know if this is my actual problem, and at the same time, I am already completely convinced it is. I used to have a girlfriend, we were together for 7 years. She too had BPD, and we really understood eachother. But she got treatment and I didn't, because I always denied suffering from it. She actually became a much partner than I did, and my fear of her leaving me started to kick in. I became obsessed. Very obsessed. I installed apps on her phone to check on her all the time without her knowing. I wouldn't allow her to leave the house after a while (not physically, though.) because I would throw tantrums whenever she did. And all of it felt... Justified.

Until march of 2017, she left me for my best friend. I'm glad she did. She deserved someone much better than me. She seems happy now, finally.

But until a while ago, I always blamed her for everything. For the failure of our relationship. I blamed her BPD and swore I would never date anyone with BPD again. I was 100% sure that having BPD made someone absolutely crazy and inhumane. Oh, how wrong I was.


I'm sorry for judging you all. I really am. Monday I will post an update (if I don't forget) to let everyone here know how it all went.

I want to thank you all, for sharing your experiences, for offering advice in your threads, but also for the rants I have seen that made me feel like I was not alone in this.

Sorry, this really turned into a rant and basically one enormous run on sentence about a lot of stuff. I'm just so lost in my own thoughts and feelings.","The expanded size of the tensor (661) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.  Target sizes: [1, 661].

"Dating, current culture, my weak mind. So i went on a date with a stunning girl from tinder. She asked me out first actually. The date went great we made out had a blast. Adds my snapchat. Then radio silence. I think i might not be cut out for this shit. Have not sent a bunch of needy texts or said anything at all, thankfully i grew out of irrational behavior of this nature. Still. It bugs me so damn bad. Felt like complete utter shit for days. I think this technology shit and dating apps etc, are being used in a disproportionately unhealthy way. Our culture reeks of it. I love technology. But damn. People are basically consumer objects at this point. This is my subjective point of view i understand this. To some degree i suspect the demands put on us in this society, are higher than what i am able to produce. I know that i am being a whiney bitch now, so what if she doesn't reply. I know... Just thought we hit it off so damn well. But I guess today things are moving so fast my childish conceptions of relationships needs an update. Apologies fellow mammals. I have no other place to vent something as pathetic as this. Take care.

"I want to go to therapy, now what? Well i'm not officially diagnosed with anything, i've never been in therapy or anything like that. I'm an 18 years old boy.

Since years i feel that something isn't okay... I can relate with EVERY bpd thing what i have read on the internet and it's not a periodic interest..

But because i'm socially anxious as hell going to therapy or something like that is nothing but a fucking nightmare. I mean sometimes even the fact that i'm existing makes me feel awkward and i want to cry because i realize that other people can see/hear me and i don't want nobody to see me.

"So did you ever leave a favorite person out of boredom? Let's say you felt crazy about this person. They are perfect. Hell maybe they are even a narcissist. (Many borderlines' favorite project.) They aren't interested in you romantically. It feels like an endless game of cat and mouse. You chase, they give you friendship and you are on your best behavior for them. Months and maybe even almost a year of this goes by, maybe you even sleep together on occasion. You date others but they aren't your favorite person so they are just sort of distant companions - they could be gone tomorrow and it wouldn't make a single difference in your life.


But your favorite person? No way. You won't let go of them even if they don't reciprocate or aren't any good for you. 


Then your favorite person let's you in. After tireless efforts they show genuine interest in you.


And you hit a wall. 


I am starting to wonder if as a borderline I meet this with an attitude of ""boredom"" when for others boredom is translated into contentednes, happiness or comfort. Or maybe I also feel comfort in realizing that person doesn't plan to leave and I don't know how to react to that - do I stay and risk them abandoning me? Or do I leave before they can hurt me? More importantly - why do I not care which one happens.


I guess it's hard to just accept that someone would accept me like that. Even with having major flaws. Even with them knowing I have a major personality disorder....


 I still feel what my therapist and I refer to as ""the emptiness"" but it's worse than it even was before I met him. 


Emptiness has been replaced with straight up boredom. I wanted him romantically for a year. Now I have him and don't want him. Maybe I want to keep him as a friend but not a romantic partner. 


I believe this also is because I experienced true intimacy with him and over the years intimacy is something I have learned that I abhor. 


I have considered ghosting him. After a year of talking every single day I really am considering leaving for good. And I know it was the intimacy. I never go into these things thinking, ""hmm if I f*ck him after letting him get to know me I'll get over him."" 


If I sleep with a person I barely know and admire I want to keep them forever. But if we know each other, forget it. I lose interest. And now my favorite person, just like every one of his predecessors, is about to be put in the corner with the rest. :-(

"Wisdom for the day: sometimes you have to lose Sometimes in life, in relationships especially, you HAVE to lose for the best things to happen to you.

The win/lose dynamic sucks, in my opinion, but is something many people (not just those with BPD) are prone to in their relationships.

I just want to tell you not to fear being on the ""lose"" side of that equation. I don't mean assure yourself you WON'T lose. I mean be open to it. Because you gain soooo much from that.

So much that was infinitely more important, and valuable to me, than the first person I really *lost* to.

"Sure this has been posted several hundred times in this subreddit before but fuck its annoying, I hate going from adoration to cold indifference. I especially do this to my partner, any moment something remotely difficult comes up I immediately cut all the emotional ties, I think about breaking up instantly to avoid any future heartache and sink the ship first. I don't cry or feel upset/angry at all when I think about or consider it, Its like I'm frozen over, I'm calm and distant and just forget them instantly. All those good memories are long gone in those moments. I've done it to everyone before and I'm sure I can do it again.


It fucks with my head in such a bad way. Because when everything is okay in general I'm so adoring of her and feel like we can go the distance, having been in several serious relationships this one actually feels different.Then this steely side takes over me and I find myself not giving a fuck about anyone or my partner, they can go die and Ill be fine as far as I'm concerned. Yes it sounds really goddamn fucking shitty of me, I can hear myself but thats what goes through my mind.


Ive had this discussion briefly with my psychologist that I seem to have an amazing ability to deeply disassociate, sometimes at will and sometimes when i don't want it. Like most of us, i think my past wasn't that bad or traumatic and brush it off, the evidence seems to say otherwise though. Its good in some ways, the resilience will be something ill really need in my career path but it just fucks me over with people and relationships, and I feel like ill never have the chance to be...happy, genuine happy. I've heard from psychologists and psychiatrists I may have had RAD or a disorganised attachment disorder as a kid and thats probably formed the current mess I am.

"BPD = Opinionated? DBT is supposed to train us to not have black-white thinking, but... I didn't have much success with this (eg. I got pissed off and quit). I think it's safe to say that people with BPD are ""highly opinionated"". I imagine those who aren't diagnosed get labeled as such.

I realize I have an issue with dealing with (some) friends of my friends. Friends = cool. Friends of friends? Sometimes cool, sometimes OMFG I HATE THEM SO MUCH. But I'll grin and bear it because I care about my friend... For the time being -_-. Same goes for some people's significant others. In the past, I would just drop everyone and disappear. Burn the bridge *and* the towns on either side, as I like to refer to it. But, this is becoming increasingly difficult.

"This might be my lowest point yet Long story short: My ex that I still consider (or considered now that the dust is settling down) my best friend for the last 2 years, 3 months of which was actual dating, has found a partner. I'm happy for her, I really am, but...since it happened, she slowly drifted away from me...or I did. It's hard to say anymore but the facts are that she was the first and last person I talked to every day for those 2 years and in alot of those days, the only person I talked to.

She saved me from a pit of despair after my best friend vanished out of thin air (I literally don't know what happened to him, he could be dead or homeless and I wouldn't know) and even though she left me because she ""didn't feel that way about me anymore"", we still stayed friends because...I had no one else really...

And now, I'm back with myself, alone and abandoned for what I wish I could say was the first time, but even though I had suicide attempts before, this feels...somehow worse. I can't even feel the pain from the cigarette burns, I don't feel joy anymore and I can't sleep. I just feel...so alone...

Every one around me kept saying how great their holidays were and I sit here like ""none of you called me..."" but I still had her, I thought her having found a partner wouldn't change our relationship, but it did.

The worst part in this is that it's 100% my fault: I kept telling her how lost and depressed I was and when she found an option to finally be happy without having me to drag her down, what I kept telling her for 2 years, which is she'll eventually grow tired of me and leave, is actually happening. I drove her away with my eternal cynicism and now, I have to face what I was afraid would happen. Oh the irony...

I deleted my Facebook, not because of her, just to get my bearings and isolate myself a bit...that doesn't seem to make sense but I couldn't stand seeing all this happiness on my feed coupled with hers, it just crushes me even more knowing that I can't feel happiness as much as I can feel brief euphoria only to go back to a depressed/numb state for days on end.

I don't want to die...but I don't want to live either...not anymore, I'm too tired of fighting myself, my insecurities, my paranoïa and my self loathing...","The expanded size of the tensor (539) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.

"Putting unnecessary emphasis on little things. Last night, my boyfriend and I went out into town. I made the impulsive decision to invite someone else along since I hadn't seen them in a while. I knew it'd put me in a bad mood, so I made sure that we left after about 45 minutes. My boyfriend and I were trying to figure out where to eat, and by the time we got to the restaurant, we didn't have time because we spent those 45 minutes somewhere else. Instead of just accepting that I had made a silly choice and moving on, I got hysterical and cried for over an hour about how I was ruining everything and how all I wanted to do was get dinner etc.     
In that moment, I genuinely felt like if I didn't get to go out for dinner with him our relationship was over and I'd lose him. Rationally, that makes zero sense. He told me himself that it wasn't a big deal. The thing is, I didn't even really want to get dinner that bad! It wasn't a special occasion and I didn't dress up or spend extra time for these plans. Yet I put so much weight on the plan going EXACTLY how I had it in my head that I had a complete meltdown when it went a little off track due to my own behavior.

"How to let people in? I realized recently that I have a pattern of dating narcissists (literal, diagnosed - and others with glaringly obvious traits). I just met someone so easily and he’s exactly what I’m looking for. He’s so sweet, always complimenting me, and we’ve been texting each other novels since we met. 

My problem is that I’m used to choosing people who are wrong for me and the more they push me away, the more interested I am. That, on top of having BPD has me curious. How do y’all stop yourselves from splitting when someone good comes along?

I’m at a point in my life where I see the patterns of where I’ve gone wrong and I do want a serious relationship.

I’ve put a lot of work (and therapy hours) into working through the breakup and have been doing a lot better. I’ve also been dating and met a guy with whom I connect very well.

"TW: childhood/sexual abuse .....my parents were my first sexual contact So....I just understood that because of ""old style"" spanking (lowering pants and underwear, hard hand across the ass), Ive developed sexual PTSD towards my parents. I have come to the incredibly gross conclusion that my parents were, in fact, the first people to touch my body in a sexual manner/context (Im not sure how to formulate this, basically it was always in the context of ""discipline"" but touching your kids private parts isnt discipline, its harassment). 

I dont know how to cope, I feel dirty and tainted. I want to remove my skin, I dont know how to explain this but I just feel so horribly nasty. My PARENTS have been the first people in my sexual discovery. MY PARENTS. What the fuck?!?!?! Not a loved one, not a friend, not a crush, not anything like that. NO. My parents have been the firsts to trigger sexual feelings against my consent. I had a very early sexual awakening but my parents ""weaned off"" spanking quite late, like pre-puberty kinda late. I feel so disgusted.

ANd to add to that, my mother has always grabbed and fondled my ass without consent (despite me saying I hated it and to stop). She continued because ""she made me so she can do whatever she wants because thats her ass"". 

I dont care what you think, okay, but all spanking did for me was teach me that adults can touch my private parts if they believed I did something wrong, that it was okay for adults to touch me sexually and I shouldnt say no because thats lacking respect, that I do not deserve consent or the right to say no, that adults should be feared and never trusted, and that violence is the only way out. Because of this, it took me an incredibly long amount of time to believe Ive been raped and abused in one of my relationships. I took me two years before I seeked PTSD support for the sexual trauma.

"I’ve been told I’m selfish and manipulative Hello, I don’t tend to post about this kinda stuff much since I’m bad at wording things. This stuff happened a few weeks ago and I’m still trying to come to terms with it. Basically, I think I finally broke my FP a few weeks ago she had been helping me for a long time, keeping me feeling happy because she wanted me to be happy this was until she found out about me self-harming, I think her having to deal with the fact sometimes she hasn’t been able to help me enough that it’s brought me to hurt myself has just crushed her. Even though I don’t see that as the reason I self-harm..

I got a call from one of her friends and I was basically told all I do is manipulate her into helping me by constantly making her feel bad that I do all of this shit to myself. I was called a selfish manipulative person to do this to someone like her. 

Now I just feel this is the way I am, me and my FP don’t talk as much as we did anymore and it’s crushing me because I love her and care about her so much, she told me this isn’t the case but I feel like it must be because she just doesn’t seem to want to speak with me much anymore. This is just making me feel terrible about everything and I just don’t know how to process shit or even attempt to let her go. I don’t know if I should just let her go, or if I should just try to explain myself fully...

I just feel empty without her here and I don’t know how to go on feeling like this... :(

"My problem with an employer's questions about mental health Today I found myself in an interesting conundrum. I reapplied to the place I used to work before I left for college. I interviewed, passed a drug test and everything. They asked some general questions about mental health along with their littany of other medical health history questions. It was a general question. I answered that yes I was diagnosed with depression (i feel like I shouldn't have had to answer this) and that I was seeing someone about it. Also I included that I was perscribed medication that I was no longer taking. They didn't ask me to elaborate so I didn't. 2 days later, today, I called hr at the company to ask if my information was properly sent in. They said I was not cleared but recommended me to reach out to the center for drug testing myself, which I then did. 

This is where I found out that the reason my info was not yet sent over, was that they believed I was medically unstable since I was not taking my medications as prescribed. Now, this is a legitimate concern, but I object to being questioned about this or have this come in the way of my job for a few reasons. First off, I was taking one ssri, at a medium dosage at the time I went to school. I've been on heavier prescribed cocktails that will fuck you up if you stop taking them. This is not the case here. By a month into the semester I was running out and asked the student health center about prescription refills, but they told me my insurance hasn't been established yet; there was a problem with my admission, yada yada. So fuck. I was out of medication soon after but without health insurance to refill, also I lacked the money to see my home doctor to get this straightened out. Months later, I got my insurance card from the school and by that time, I was near finals, and I was scared to pick up taking the dose that I had before. So yeah, I let things slide. However I was really broke and very busy with school, every day left me exhausted. I could barely afford gas or pay a copay on a drug refill.
 Also, subsequent visits to the health center on campus, the staff were much less than helpful in finding me help.
Basically, it feels like they assume that I just woke up and decided to say fuck you to my doctors recommendations and to better mental health, by choosing not to take my meds when this couldn't be farther from the truth.
 
Secondly, I feel that this isn't really their business. I understand their concern about stability as an employee, but I haven't fallen off the cliff because of not taking my medication. Im not a danger to myself or others. I have not been impaired mentally. In spite of my situation, I passed my hard ass science courses with As and finished out the semester. I take care of myself well, within the means that I can. I am not unhygienic, lazy, or incapable. I just don't think that this is entirely my employer's business to judge my mental state based on the fact that I had a lapse in medical insurance and couldn't take my meds.

Now they need a doctors note saying that I'm okay, with or without the medication, and for me to fax that info to them. I am not sure I even have the money to see my doc atm, money is very tight. But I guess I will just have to scrounge! Anyway. This may take some time but I know I will eventually be able to show them I have seen my doctor, and that she says I'm safe with it or going back on it and then will be safe. 

**TL; DR:**
I'm aplying for a job and they asked why I'm not taking my medication as prescribed. I say it was because of losing health insurance. They still need clearance from my doctor.

So basically, yeah. I am mad because I don't really feel that this is their business. I'm not an unstable individual and have spent years in therapy working out the worst of my problems. I haven't been suicidal for years. However I understand that they will do what they can to make sure I'm not mentally unstable and so on and so forth.

What do you think, is the employer completely in the right? Or do I have a reason to feel upset?","The expanded size of the tensor (924) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.  Target sizes: [1, 924].  Tensor sizes: [1, 514]"
"I think I avoid finding a job because I'm afraid of people and not being in control I don't think I'm much of a control freak and I'm a pretty ""go with the flow"" kind of person, but I can usually read and keep a sense of control over a situation. If a loved one gets upset with me I freak out but eventually calm down amd we can talk it out. I can't do that with an employer or a customer or client. When I was working it was in retail and the amount of verbal abuse I went through was traumatizing for me and I still don't feel recovered from it.

My family and my therapist more or less tell me to get over it since I need an income and I need to be able to pay for insurance. I'm super annoyed with my therapist because I can't just ""get over it"" and she should know that. Maybe I'm just being a big baby? Idk. I just wanted to vent about this because it's become a huge stressor in my life

"I’m sorry I’m not a girl enough. I was born a girl. So there’s that. People who weren’t get more love for being girly than I ever have. I’m too fat to be attractive. I’m too smart to be cute. If I knew what it was that makes me a 3rd strong friend I would do everything to change it. I didn’t have my first kiss until I was 17, and almost blackout drunk, with a guy I didn’t like. My first long term boyfriend was only long term because he was so abusive I was afraid he would kill me. When I finally decided I didn’t care and was leaving he raped me. My family didn’t know for years afterwards. My dad still thinks he was a good guy and resents me leaving. People I thought were friends told me I was lying, some who were in the same house when I was being beaten and just ignored it. I was so messed up from that that my next boyfriend convinced me he could go out with other women because “He was looking for a threesome for us”, but they couldn’t know about me because it wouldn’t work. Every other guy until my husband used me for my holes, but I wasn’t good enough to be seen in public with. The man I married loves me. We were acquaintances/friends for 15 years and he originally thought I was ugly and unattractive. He had to tell me we were on our first date because I thought it was another situation of FWB. Often I have to remind him that I tell him he’s attractive and need the same in return. 
I don’t really have friends. I have people I call friends who will think of me as an afterthought. They won’t kick me out, but there are always other people they think of before me. I have never had a real best friend. I have never had a girls night. Never had movie nights, never been invited to the party until other people have declined, or people want to invite my husband. He’s (my husband) noticed this phenomenon as well. To the point he’s stated multiple times he doesn’t understand it, even in himself before we dated, why I get ignored all the time.
I just don’t know what to do anymore. People always say “Hang in there, it will get better.” But it doesn’t. My birthday is in 3 weeks. I asked my husband to set up the party for me so I don’t have to do it this time. Apparently we’re not having a party. It hasn’t changed in 39 years and I’m so broken.
I just want to be the girl. To be weak and taken care of for a bit. To have someone tell me I’m beautiful and wanted. To hold me and bring me flowers. To show me affection without my begging, and to just be able to be hurt or upset without being alone in it, or told they’re not going to cater to my emotions. I desperately want someone to cater to my emotions just for a bit because I’m not as strong as this life is forcing on me.

TL:DNR I am so horribly broken, have had a lot of bad in my life, feel like I’m all alone, and nothing ever gets better. My brain hurts, my heart hurts, and my body is disgusting.

"I had the most interesting conversation today.... so let me preface this by saying I have been diagnosed by several different doctors in two states with borderline personality disorder. however, for reasons I will later explain, I will be calling it “BPD symptoms” instead. 

so I had my first Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy session today. if you haven’t heard of if, pls just look it up bc I’m too tired to explain. sorry y’all. so this guy’s name is Bill &amp; he is fuckin AWESOME. you know how a lot of therapists and honestly just most doctors in general just like.. all talk in that super soft &amp; lowkey (ok maybe highkey lmao) condescending voice? ya so this guy doesn’t do that which is so so great bc that shit is SO annoying tbh. anyway.. so I went in not rly knowing what to expect and had a lot of questions, all of which ofc my manic ass brain decides to forget about as soon as I sat on the brown leather couch in the office. he asked me several questions, and then he said something I’ve never heard before.... he said borderline personality disorder the way we know it to be doesn’t really exist. he said that (which I kindof already knew) BPD symptoms are trauma induced. he said that it’s a defense mechanism, much like any other, that’s our brains way of dealing with trauma. he said that with time and practice and patience, I can be cured of those BPD symptoms as if it were the flu or something. because BPD symptoms are not chemical or anything, they’re developed over time because of trauma and abuse and neglect and several other reasons, and each individual has their own specifics. but ya man idk I’m like .. floored by everything he said today and I wanted to get some other opinions and experiences before I go back for my first actual session on Monday. 

anyone have thoughts or experience with this?

"is it possible for your FP to be someone you haven't talked to in a year? I'm somewhat new to this sub and I just recently learned about the whole FP concept.

"So Narcissistic Personality Disorder (covert subtype) and Borderline Personality Disorder (quiet subtype) seem to overlap at every point except at their the very core. How would one differentiate the two? I am a 21yr old male that has been diagnosed with BPD for a little over a year now. For quite a time before my diagnosis I figured that I had a Cluster B Personality Disorder, with my guess being on BPD, seeing as I displayed the underlying maladaptive coping mechanisms such as significant sensitivity to rejection, splitting, etc... 


At the time I knew that I wasn't AsPD, HPD, and I knew that I wasn't NPD however I was only aware of the Exhibitionist and Malignant subtypes. I did end up meeting either 8/9 or 9/9 of the diagnostic criteria for BPD which led to my diagnosis.


Recently I heard of the Covert subtype of NPD. After researching this subtype it really seems almost indistinguishable from the Quiet subtype of BPD. Covert NPD utilizes a nearly identical list of maladaptive behaviours as BPD has, including splitting, significant sense-of-self issues, idealization/devaluation, etc... 


Apparrently the contexts in which these two disorders utilize these bahaviours can show slight distinctions from one another, but I'm not really able to find any information on how they actually differ. The only clear separating point of these two disorders is that at the core Covert Narcissism the individual is disgusted by who they are so they project a facade (deeply hates and therefore hides their real semse-of-self), while Quiet Borderlines project a facade because at the core they don't know who they are (lacking a consistent sense-of-self).


Is this really all that separates these?

"Trying to save a marriage I have BPD. Or maybe bipolar. No diagnosis, but symptoms of each. And it's destroying my marriage. 

My wife (who has major depressive disorder) said something to me this morning along the lines of ""I love you less than I did."" She backtracked a little after talking to me for a while, and ended with the sentiment ""I want a future with you, but if you keep treating me this way (ie, yelling at me so often and being unkind for reasons that aren't always clear) then I'm going to have to leave you.""

My heart is breaking. And I understand where she's coming from. I want to stop and I don't know how. I'm enrolled in DBT and have been for almost 6 months, I've completely changed my diet and prescriptions in an attempt to stabilize my mood, and everything helps a little bit. But I need more time. And she, reasonably, is running out of patience. Is there some sort of magic bullet (maybe a DBT skill I haven't learned yet) that I can use to improve my behavior, like, IMMEDIATELY? Or, spouses of folks with BPD, do you have any success stories about living happy lives together without divorcing due to mental illness and emotional instability?

"Anyone here with suspected and/or diagnosed Aspergers? Long story short; posted to /r/aspergers regarding the similarities, misdiagnosis and co-morbidity of BPD and Aspergers and one user was kind enough to suggest posting here, so here I am :)

Been diagnosed with borderline-BPD, but some things don't feel right, although I did/do exhibit some traits. After some serious google abuse, came across to Aspergers and how BPD can resemble Aspergers in females and probably vice-versa. Since this is all rather confusing for me at the moment and I relate to more Aspergers traits than BPD, I would appreciate if any of you could maybe share your experiences with the subject. I am aware that reddit cannot compensate for a proper assessment.

Also, I am aware that the confusion arises from a possibility of BPD rationalization, so that's what I'm confused about, if that makes sense.

Personally, I don't feel empty, don't self harm nor I'm suicidal, I think I have a stable sense of identity and don't usually overreact to abandonment (real or imaginary), but I did get out of the dysfunctional relationship where my reactions were erratic and was also diagnosed during the last couple of months of rl.

Thank you in advance!

"“Reflectly” app has proven extremely helpful at tracking my BPD. Reflectly is a journal app that prompts you to express your mood and reflect on why you are in that mood. It’s keeps track of your entry’s and after 6 days it creates a chart that allows you to see when there is a dip or spike in mood. 

You can make as many entry’s per day as you would like, so you don’t need to sum up the entire day with one emotion. And the entry’s only take a minute or two. 

I would highly suggest anybody that wants to know more about their personal BPD pattern to give this app a chance. It couldn’t get easier, it’s customizable, helpful, and even a little fun.

"Psychiatrist told me that I am ""unstable"" and seem to have BPD. What do I do next? So I finally got to see a psychiatrist, he spent 3 hours going through my mental health history etc. and in the end he is of the opinion that I am unstable based on my behaviour, such as sudden bursts of anger (rip MacBook and old phone), how any criticism for minor things leads me to end up hating myself anymore and self destructing, how I can't really look after myself very well and how I have extreme reactions to things like being assaulted, dumped etc.  

The whole thing has freaked me out a bit if I am honest. I tried to read about it and to be honest from what I have read I can't really fault his conclusion. 

I just want to be normal but I have no idea whats next apart from a doctors appointment tomorrow ","[[{'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.24669891595840454}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.2137070745229721}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.20902492105960846}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.12893924117088318}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.1115073412656784}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.09141146391630173}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.05766883119940758}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.03674577921628952}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.031561627984046936}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.030604327097535133}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.020704960450530052}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.017744284123182297}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.014744128100574017}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.008935623802244663}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.00796776358038187}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.007517337799072266}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.006888936273753643}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.0060672881081700325}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.005971917416900396}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.005318707320839167}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.004261681344360113}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.0036279524210840464}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.003042405005544424}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.002876131795346737}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.001580281532369554}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.0012790528126060963}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.0008309935219585896}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.00024401331029366702}]]"
"How do I deal with this? Little bit of story; I got diagnosed with BPD in May 2017 after i made an attempt on my life but had a dear friend call me and talk me off the edge. I'm from a close knit family with a little sister that causes me problems and has been tagged as the reason for my mental instability.

Now my nan is very ill and I've never had to deal with something like this. She's the one who always understood me and always new there was an issue that hadn't been touched on. I'm scared she's going to die and abandon me with these people who don't understand.

"Coming to terms with BPD diagnosis... Hey all, lurker for a while but felt like posting today.  

So I've actually been diagnosed with Borderline for about 3 years- first by another psychiatrist but thereafter by my current doc who is also treating me for Bipolar Type 2. During my appointment with my doc on Monday he focused quite a bit on my Borderline (or EUPD as I'm in the UK) diagnosis, saying that he felt the Borderline 'triggers' my bipolar mood swings, which he feels has been happening since I was a teenager (I'm now 27). He put a lot of emphasis on working with my therapist who is helping me with my triggers and how to deal with them, and told me I need to go away and work on these triggers I keep having. My therapist is taking the psychodynamic/ psychoanalytic route with a bit of DBT and CBT thrown in there- in short I'm very lucky to have him. In brief, a lot of my triggers centre around festive seasons, my birthday, my dad's death and my kids which is the worst part- it basically means I can't have them on my own because I get explosive rages that I find difficult to deal with.

I wanted to ask you guys a question, if I may. How have you all approached treating your condition? How have you dealt with your triggers and do you all have any stories of success? I'm feeling really down in the dumps at the moment and feeling as though my Borderline diagnosis is actually something new, when actually it isn't. Any help, stories or anything about triggers would be hugely appreciated. Thanks!","[[{'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.47434139251708984}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.11500508338212967}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.09843523055315018}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.09009576588869095}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.05738891288638115}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.05409345030784607}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.03702400624752045}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.034894704818725586}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.023847613483667374}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.017738500609993935}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.01647942326962948}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.014796901494264603}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.014048738405108452}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.008971384726464748}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.008679034188389778}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.007693717256188393}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.0069310227409005165}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.006128343287855387}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.006020707543939352}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.005926836282014847}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.004931909032166004}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.003623379161581397}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.003594036214053631}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.003206051653251052}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.0022604353725910187}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.0017921925755217671}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.0011008767178282142}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.0010306823533028364}]]"

"Although I ve been diagnosed with bpd, I feel lost. Most of the symptoms weren't clear before 2017. There was only the feeling of emptiness and the polorized feelings. I avoided people at all costs with some failed trials of having friends.
 
In 2017, the risky unhealthy decisions began; (smoking, drinking, strangers). My spirtual faith died. I tried to get close alot of people and kept pushing and pulling. I couldn't even keep a 2 months relationship/friendship. My first time drinking was very embarrassing to the extent people avoided me the following day.
I try to go through treament on my own as my parents say that I don't have anything, although I went to a psychiatrist. The DBT workbook is not working for me much.

Now, I don't feel like talking to anyone even my friends. I don't pursue my hobbies. I feel disappointed and depressed every time I would like to start a new activity. I fear that if I stay like this, I'd regret wasting my youth just like I regret wasting my childhood. I am anxious.
 

How to get myself out of the depressing loop? I am aware that I should start doing something positive but I cannot help myself to do anything. I try to practice mindfulness but then I get overwhelmed with thoughts and feelings.","[[{'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.3974049389362335}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.30870166420936584}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.18922162055969238}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.05690847709774971}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.05299031734466553}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.047831304371356964}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.041171226650476456}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.03703153878450394}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.03640001267194748}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.031140392646193504}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.030895158648490906}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.021239589899778366}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.019980305805802345}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.011537956073880196}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.0072936126962304115}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.006926403380930424}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.006019243970513344}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.005950014106929302}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.005016449373215437}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.004935467150062323}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.004777856171131134}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.004770809784531593}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.004412383306771517}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.004280216060578823}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.0026288155931979418}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.002130707958713174}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.0007779055158607662}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.0004931798321194947}]]"

"I [36 M] think my new gf [29 F] might have BPD. It has been a non-stop emotional roller coaster since we met. Should I breakup with her? My gf and I met about 8 weeks ago on a dating website. She's beautiful, intelligent, seemingly emotionally in touch with herself, and we have ridiculous physical and mental chemistry. When we are in a room, we are like two magnets. We can talk for hours about anything while time stands still. On the surface, it seems like the best relationship I've ever had. BUT, she is highly medicated for a chronic condition and a mental illness (which one I'm not sure). She also has self-harm scars from the past - a typical borderline feature. I am fine with someone having a mental illness and can relate as I've struggled most of my life with severe anxiety. Her behaviour is sometimes erratic and self-destructive though. She will go out several nights in a row sometimes and drink heavily. She'll post selfie upon selfie on social media which seems excessive and screams for attention despite me being here ready to give her all eyes. 

Three weeks into our relationship she claimed it was too intense even though she has been the primary instigator of most of that intensity: sex, flattery, wanting to be girlfriend and boyfriend, and what maybe feels like manipulation to make me fall for her. Of course I've fallen hard, can't wait to see her, have sex again, am already imagining spending the rest of our lives together. I've never been in a dating situation that's progressed so quickly and felt so euphoric. I can't help but feel infatuated but at the same time I can't help but suspect I am entering into a non-stop roller coaster ride of ups and downs and feeling terrible about myself for the littlest thing. At times It feels like I'm walking on eggshells and that anything could make her feel insecure or upset her. Sometimes I question whether I'm dating ""a crazy person"", which is the last thing I need in my life right now (instability). On the other hand I think we just have a rare amazing connection that I should hold onto and cherish. I don't want to end things but if it's only going to be more destructive and unpredictable, I should probably act early. People with BPD: what should I do?? What are your perspectives on relationships? I think I'm in love with this woman.

"Dumping my friends without warning A few weeks ago I woke up and decided I was very irritated with my close friend for no reason besides the fact that I didn’t have the mental energy to talk to her as much as she messages me. She wants to talk via text 24/7 and I suddenly found it (and her) very annoying. So I pretty much ghosted, although I told her in advance I can’t talk that much because I’m going through serious health struggles (mental and physical... which is true). I feel really guilty but I’ve done this before to friends. I think part of it has to do with my current FP. If they are not talking to me, I suddenly don’t want to hear from anybody else. Anyone else do this?

"I think I'm relapsing, doctors response is... hmmm I was doing really well for a few months until yesterday when my anxiety started going through the roof, way way above where it normally is even at my most stressed. It was triggered by some fairly gritty family goings-on. None of my usual coping techniques were working. This is my first relapse indicator; often it gets much crazier from here, and so far it's looking that way again. I have good insight and can put things into action to a point - if I get so far along though, I lose my insight and any control, and that's where my life becomes at risk. This has happened a number of times.

I've been given 2mg of diazepam to take 3x a day, up to 4mg at once, but so far this is isn't doing anything to take the edge off. When I last relapsed, I went up to 20mg a day which still didn't really do a lot to help, and I ended up in hospital having tried to take my life shortly after. My ""relapse management plan"" stops at the point where I'm given this drug, and there's no contingency for if that fails. My last social worker said off the record that if that's the case then to do what I need to do to prevent a life-threatening situation (referring to my smoking weed in previous crises with good results). I think this is ridiculous; I shouldn't have to rely on self-medicating with street drugs to get things under control. 

Is there anything specific I can ask about when I see the doctor tomorrow that might give me enough of a rest so that I can fight this? Right now I've nudged one of my meds (pregabalin) up a notch to try and chill me the fuck out, but the weekend is approaching and there's no access to mental health services during that time; if things become dicey in this time then I'm on my own.","[[{'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.17278973758220673}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.14015409350395203}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.13033351302146912}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.11243772506713867}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.10415057092905045}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.0908895805478096}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.07269460707902908}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.06895086169242859}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.06461092829704285}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.039301514625549316}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.03778023645281792}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.032595667988061905}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.01998123899102211}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.014496677555143833}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.0072261071763932705}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.006593459285795689}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.006319914013147354}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.005239997059106827}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.0047844224609434605}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.00468237791210413}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.004145032726228237}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.003971603699028492}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.003031700849533081}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.002915790071710944}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.0019097632030025125}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.00117192801553756}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.00100631860550493}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.0003188243426848203}]]"
"I don’t want my friends anymore First time posting on here. Just wanted to say thank you all for helping me not feel so alone before I explain myself. 

Anyway, I don’t want my close friends anymore. They’re all great but their lives are moving forward and they’re leaving me behind. We still keep in contact, but they don’t want to help me. 

I’m moving back home soon and I know I need to make this decision before I go back. The town I’m in now has been really toxic and put me in a bad place. Lots of substance abuse issues and all of my friends that saw me in that place just kinda left me. They decided they didn’t want anything to do with me till I calmed down on the drinking yet they still invite me to party every time I see them. I’m not as out of control as before but I’m still empty. I wish they would attempt to do sober things with me

I have cried to my friends about how bad it is and how close I am to ending it all. All I get is “I love you. Dont do that, I would be devastated. I dont know what I would do.” but they don’t reach out to me. They don’t try to help me get help or in to a better situation. I have begged people to help me and they never get back to me. Even after I overdosed, nobody really cares (except for my mom)

These are my best friends, they’re basically family and its so hard. I don’t know if I’m overreacting or if I have a right to say I deserve people who actually care about me.

"Body-Focused Repetitive Disorders/OCD and BPD? I am just curious if anyone in the BPD community also has OCD or BFRs? Is this common for people with BPD? How do you deal with it day to day? 

For some background I was diagnosed about a decade ago. I'm a 27yr old female and have not been in therapy since high school. I started biting my nails in childhood. I also chew my lips and pick my skin and pull my hair. And I'm very anal about how things are organized. I get super anxious or angry when my things are touched or moved.

"VENT I’m just posting here as a way to get my emotions out there somewhere. 
I feel so empty right now and I don’t even know why. 
I posted here a while ago saying how much better I felt etc but honestly now I just feel awful again. 

I had an appointment today with a psychiatric nurse and I feel like she judged me SO MUCH it was awful. 
Also I think I’m becoming addicted to painkillers because I just want to feel constantly numb. 

All that’s going around my head is that one day things are gonna get too much and I will kill myself, it feels inevitable at this point.

"My husband tried to cheat on me and I want to die Husband tried to get with an 18 y/o coworker. I feel like it's my fault due to my mental health. I've been doing better (particularly managing mood swings and self soothing a lot better) and as a result our relationship has significantly improved, along with the help of weekly marriage counseling. I love this man so much and it seems that he really loves me but I can't seem to cope with the fact that he still works with the 18 y/o at a job that requires them to work together with one-on-one constant contact. As much as I fight it, I can't help but break down thinking about what they're talking about, what he's thinking about as he looks at her, etc...I get panic attacks when they close together, fearing that he'll give her a ride home (he's done this before where on one occasion he reached over and squeezed her thigh) and invite himself up into her bed. I can't get past the fact that at one point, he couldn't wait to get away from me and run into her arms. I want so badly to forgive and move on but I feel retraumatized every day he works with her. I've begged him to find a new job as his current job was supposed to be temporary anyway, but he claims he needs to ""take his own time"" to find a new job - however his attempts to job search have been little to none. I feel as if he uses my BPD to gaslight me for my concerns and I'm not sure whether or not my fears are rational or just my mental illness getting to me. I'm going insane and I know I can't live like this much longer, but after several failed attempts to leave him I feel trapped in this hellish scenario. I've isolated myself from friends and family...any support I had. I've barely been working because I can't function well enough too. I can't even bring myself to go outside and can barely get myself to reach out online. I'm drowning fast.

"Mother announced at Christmas that she'd been diagnosed with BPD years ago - but she doesn't know what it is Hello! I'm after some advice, please! Thanks in advance for taking the time to read.

A bit of background:

She's always like alcohol and always drank quite a lot when I was growing up. We've always had a rocky relationship but we kind of get on with each other most of the time. I know of at least two occasions where she's tried to commit suicide - once when I was about five years old and again when I was fourteen. I wasn't living with her at the time and didn't find this out until I was much older.

I've always been aware that she has issues (with what I thought was just depression and anxiety) and put it partly down to her abusive childhood but since she had to have her horse put down about five years ago, she is drinking a lot every day. She is verbally abusive to my step-dad and says really hurtful things to me and it has gotten to a point where I actually can't stand to be around her.

So, fast forward to Christmas just gone. I was talking about someone else having just been diagnosed with BPD (a friend that she doesn't know) and her exact words were ""Oh, I have that. I psychiatrist told me years ago. Whatever that means.""

For me, I was shocked (though I hid it) but it was also like she was telling me something I had always known and suddenly everything made sense!

I knew quite a bit about BPD because I suspect I have it - but that's beside the point. I think I need to talk to her about it. I'm assuming she was diagnosed after one of her suicide attempts as she doesn't have/has never had any type of therapy. I'm also blown away by the fact that no one has sat her down and talked to her about it.

I'm not sure what to do. I know for a fact she won't just go to a doctor but I'm a little worried that if I sit down with her and talk her through what BPD is (the very basics at least) it might bring up some bad stuff? On the other hand, it might be a relief to her if she knows there's a reason for it.

Do you guys have any thoughts on this?

"Emotional Support Animals in College? Hi there! I had a few questions for any people diagnosed with BPD that have an emotional support animal, especially in college.
How did you talk to your doctor about getting an ESA? Did they bring it up or did you?
How has your ESA benefitted you?
Lastly, for those of you with an ESA in college, has your school allowed your ESA to live with you in the dorms? I’ve been checking out the laws in the state I’m attending college (Wisconsin) and it seems they can’t legally deny me an ESA under the Fair Housing Act, which dorm rooms fall under, but I’ve heard of a few students having issues with colleges allowing them an ESA. 
If you’ve got any other info to share, I’d love to hear it!

"Feeling Lost First time posting here. I'm trying so hard to turn my life around. For the longest time I've been getting by on my maladaptive coping mechanisms (binge eating, shoplifting, unsafe sex &amp; smoking). 

I've recently stripped those coping mechanisms away and I'm fucking miserable. I feel like I can't be happy without them, mainly binge eating.

I started hiding food when I was a child, it was the first and most accessible coping mechanism that I had at my disposal. I've NEVER been able to stop so being on day 10 of no binging should feel like an accomplishment but instead I feel like I'm drowning. 

Binging made me feel numb. I've been on antidepressants in the past but stopped taking them 6ish months ago and I felt fine.... until now. My depression/anxiety are back in full force to a debilitating degree and I'm fucking terrified. Binging isn't even an option at this point because my anxiety completely kills my appetite.

"Physical health and fitness issues Anyone else struggling with their physical health/fitness or was able to overcome issues you had with these? In the past two years since my last suicide attempt that pushed my BPD over the line, I've gained around 50 or 60 pounds, and it makes me feel disgusting. I really hate what I see in the mirror, but food is one of my most consistent escapes and it feels like I am stuck in a loop of hating my body, eating to escape those feelings, and then making the body image issues worse, and eating to escape again.

If any of you were able to overcome this, what helped you? Was it a personal trainer holding you accountable and making you feel bad for wasting your money if you slipped up on food or skipped work outs? Was it a long period of forcing yourself to develop new eating/grocery shopping habits? Did you have friends interested in fitness as well to make working out an opportunity to hang out with them?

"Not handling the rejection/abandonment well So i met this guy, who i'd known but not well in a club and he basically told me he liked me, was nervous to speak to me etc, and didn't know i was newly (6 months) single. We kissed that night and fast forward like a week later i go to his house to watch movies. Well you know what happened there and we literally hit it off so well.

  
Before i met this guy i was struggling with having the impulsive behaviour we're known for i.e. drugs, sex, drinking, and basically having no emotional attachment to anything for a while, so i felt like this guy had stirred something back up in me and it was nice to feel happy and comfortable again.

 
anyway, fast forward a few weeks and we've seen each other a good few times, and the last time we went out it was with his friends, which i considered a big step so i was pretty excited. everything went well and it was going great, until yesterday. He turns around out of the blue and says he thinks we're looking for different things and he doesn't think he wants a relationship because he's happy with being alone, even though he likes me and enjoys spending time with me he thinks we're rushing and if he's feeling like this just now he doesn't know how he's gonna feel further down the line. 


I told him i'd give him time to think and stuff but I'm absolutely heartbroken. I'd already pictured a life with this guy (BPD psycho brain coming out) and how well we got on i hadn't clicked with someone like that in forever. My friends obviously don't understand and tell me its fine forget about him but i'm completely obsessing over it and its making me ill.


Anyone had experience with this and is able to help me chill out/ give advice :( ?

"New relationships. Advice, plz. New relationships, amiright? First one in a long, long time. For obvious reasons.

I just met this amazing guy on tinder. I never do this. I’m so self-conscious, and I put myself out there, and omg it didn’t end in fire and brimstone. I didn’t get raped and murdered, as I’ve been conditioned to believe. He’s cute and funny, and we have similar personalities. (ya know other than the vices that come with the BPD whatever I’m working on it.)

But, despite all these things, I can’t help but feel I’m going to ruin it.

I’m going to be psycho, jealous. I’m going to be suffocating. I’m going to be SO insecure. I’m going to push him away. He’s going to judge me so hard. 
Somehow, some way, we’re going to run into someone from my past that knows the “old me”, the “pre-medicated” me, he’s going to hear so many horror stories of the me that no longer exists. 
I’m terrified. 

How do I deal with this? I just want to prevent all of this, but in this small town, it’s almost impossible.

I got lucky; I met an amazing person from somewhere my reputation doesn’t proceed me. However, I’m just so worried that someway, somehow, it’s all going to come crashing down, as does every-fucking-thing-else.
I’ve worked so hard on myself. I’m taking care of myself, I’m taking my meds, I’m bettering myself, but the ghosts of my past are always there, threatening to haunt me.
I don’t want to be “crazy Ashley” anymore. I just want to be happy. 

How do you guys overcome all this bull shit??

"My friend is hurt that I don't show empathy. It's 5am the morning after my birthday and I've just got home after a night out celebrating that turned very drunken and angry towards the end. Not so much on my part, but on my friend's.

Having gone through 9 months of MBT, I'm now a lot clearer on people's actions, what may perhaps lead then to behave /think /feel a certain way. I'm more clear about how perhaps my actions can affect others and how that might perceive me based on them.

What I hadn't accounted for was being able to explain all of this and my friend still hurting and having negative feelings towards me about not showing empathy and feeling like I don't care. I've explained otherwise, but I totally understand that words don't always translate into emotionally stabilising comfort. I'm just not sure how to do that yet and I feel like all the positive things that I've achieved as well at celebrating my birthday are all now a little less significant...","[[{'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.3406473398208618}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.19991639256477356}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.14261828362941742}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.08277606964111328}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.07663870602846146}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.06639260798692703}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.06476546078920364}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.05863424390554428}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.038554102182388306}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.02560325339436531}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.016926050186157227}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.009617920033633709}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.009007075801491737}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.00827968679368496}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.008108604699373245}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.008000594563782215}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.007645363919436932}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.006401552353054285}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.00633285753428936}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.00574082974344492}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.005176885519176722}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.0041712503880262375}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.003776764264330268}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0035191115457564592}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.0031303120777010918}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.0025490326806902885}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.0019936610478907824}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.0011421835515648127}]]"
"Wife keeps bringing up past relationships First of this isn't a complaining post, its me seeking advice. 

Ive been married to my wife for a yr now. And shes been recently diagnosed with BPD. My question to this community is insecurities. My wife will randomly bring up ex-girlfriends and start to get frustrated with me saying she doesn't have their personality or look the same way or whatever it is she brings up at that time. 

I tried to comfort her with it i chose you I love you you're my wife. Im not going to leave. I say things i love about her.  But sometimes its not enough and it leads to arguements. 

Is there any advice i could get to help with this. Maybe even just understandimg her perspective could help?

"Newly diagnosed mindfuck: I feel like I was just told that there is a new color in the rainbow that everyone knew about and could see but me. I recently took a dissociative test at my new doctor’s office and I apparently scored very high dissociation on it, answering 80-100% dissociation on almost every question.

Until now, I thought that everyone was like me.
I thought everyone would just kind of notice at some point during the day, “This does not really feel real right now.” Other thoughts that cross my mind like this are like these:

- I don’t feel like the current situation I’m in is really happening.
- I don’t feel like I am really here
- I don’t believe that I am really real
- This is not real life (I even have a joke with my friends, where if something really crazy happens, for instance someone almost hits my car on the highway, I will often say to my friend jokingly, “OH MY GOD, IS THIS REAL LIFE?!”

Often while driving my car, I suddenly get a feeling that what I am doing, where I am, my entire environment, and sometimes myself, are not really real.

One thing that really is I guess odd, is that oftentimes I feel like I am starring in a movie of myself and that everyone (including me) is watching, 

Sometime I will get the feeling that someone is watching me (like how you just know someone is looking over your shoulder, or watching you if you were to turn around), and then as soon as I feel that someone is watching me (this happens a lot while driving), I will become hyper aware of my whole body and how I am presenting myself to the said person I think is watching me.

I instantly fell into acting mode and pay close attention to how I hold my body, what my posture conveys, my facial expression, I slightly pout my lips and try to appear nonchalant, I close my eyes slightly or raise my head higher and look lower with my eyes as to seem disinterested with my surroundings.

I sometimes feel(?) or thing (?) that when other people see me that they are watching me and that I am an actor trying to play myself when I am out in public, but I don’t know who that person is.

I have just always noticed this feeling/thought/whatever it may be, then went on with my day.

Now I have come to find out that I am dissociating very often, and probably for most, if not all of my days.

I have never known anything else. This is how I have functioned as far back as I can remember.

Now I find out that this is not the same experience of most other people, and I don’t really know what to do.

Is there anything you can tell me about dissociation or bpd? I am new to this.","The expanded size of the tensor (637) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.  Target sizes: [1, 637].  Tensor sizes: [1, 514]"
"Running away constantly I’m a lurker and this is my first ever post. Recently diagnosed and coming to terms with everything. 

Anyone else always feel like they’re running away from their problems? For me, it’s not just avoiding an issue or a person, it’s physically moving. I’ve lived in 5 States + Australia in the past 6 years... and every time I move to a new place and something goes wrong, I hate the place suddenly and need to move. I just moved to a new city and I’m already itching to get out because I couldn’t find a job before my visa expires (yes I’m international.) now, I’m applying to law school and the idea of committing to one State for the rest of my life has me so restless and anxious. If I hate it, I won’t be able to leave.

If any of you experience a similar “sensation” (maybe not to my extreme), how do you cope? I’m scared of the commitment because I KNOW I’ll change my mind at some time, and then I’ll feel like crap.

"Going to My Psych Eval for Federal Disability Hello,

I tagged this as venting but I'm also seeking some emotional support.

Today is my appointment for my psychiatric evaluation for social security income/disability (I live in the US). I am feeling a bunch of emotions: shame, anxiety, and anger.

I feel ashamed that I had to apply for disability in the first place.

I feel anxious that - because I have made progress in my recovery - the evaluator/psychiatrist will not think I am sick enough to get disability. When my disability truly started in August 2016, it was very obvious. When I applied for benefits in October 2017, it was very obvious. But now that it's January 2018, I am feeling better. I have my confidence back in some ways. I've also been meditating, stretching, taking baths, and prioritizing many other self-care things.

I am angry that it's taking so long to get help while my husband and I scrape by on his student loans, but when/if those disappear, we will have no back up. We have no savings because we had to burn through that to get help. We would have no way to pay rent. We would have no way to feed our animals. We would have no way to afford getting to the doctor, therapist, etc.

We will have nothing. And it's looking more and more like my husband will have to take a break again before he can finish because the remaining, final classes he needs for his degree are only offered certain times of the school year.

I do not want to hire a lawyer because we will need the back pay (if we even get anything). But we might have to hire a lawyer.

I'm scared. My livelihood is in the the line; but the old fear (that I've been fighting through in therapy) is rearing its head: *what if I'm not sick enough for help?*

I'm sick to my stomach. And it's bittersweet because it's almost better if I dysregulate during the evaluation. It's almost better if I dissociate during the evaluation. But my worst dysregulation episodes happen behind closed doors. I've tried embracing the panic in public, to really show people, but I can't. It's when I'm by myself or alone with my husband that it happens. I can control it long enough to keep most of the ""crazy"" hidden. 

But the caveat is the fear that she'll think I'm faking it *because* I have BPD.

There's nothing that can be done here. I just needed to reach out to my community. I love you all. I'll see you on the other side of this eval I guess.","The expanded size of the tensor (578) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.  Target sizes: [1, 578].

"Suicide prevention Hello guys, new here, i'm sorry if it's against the rules but i kinda have nowhere else to ask for help. Thing is, i have bpd, so with that comes all that low self steem, self harm, 3 suicidal tries in 3 days (not the ones for attention but ones Where i drove far away and shut off my phone) ok well, Back to topic, i have Been through Breakups before and even though they have been bad thanks to bdp no one was like this one. See, this girl that i knew for like 10 years had a breakup with her ex, who is a weed and cocaine addict and beats her daily and aproached me cause she always thought i was a nice guy, i said it maybe wasnt a good ideia becase we were such good friends but evetually we started a relationship, he never gave gifts for her and even though im not rich, my car broke and i used the money for repairing for buying gifts for her. My regret is because even though i have bpd i think im a nice guy and a i try a lot to be the best i can, in fact im pretty sure im not uglier tham him.

TLDR:i'm into medical school and i desperately need something to numb my feelings for at at lest a month before i suicie or get kicked (therapy won't work short term, as with antidepressants, but mays be a possibility in the future) med school is my dream bui i can't live with this feeling of worthlessness and rejection anymore i just need a month of meds that numb my feelings for that time and i can try therapy, also i have gone from 82kg to 71 in like 6 days, idk id related to food or hipovolemia since i dont eat nor drink

"I attacked and wanted to murder my boyfriend Hi so little background, I’m 20 female, bpd sufferer for uncountable years but diagnosed last year. So I’ve been in a relationship with my boyfriend for almost 3 years next month. I love him to death and he’s always supported me through my mental health issues, hospital admissions and much more. It was last week but I woke up in a horrid mood. I had ran out of tablets and I was very irritated. My boyfriend woke up also in a horrid mood and he snapped at me because I generally couldn’t see him cleaning up after he was sure I did (I didn’t). 

His cleaning and my cleaning are completely different and let’s say the room wasn’t tidied when he had finished so it got me mad. I got out of bed and started tidying it properly. 10-15 mins later he comes in the room offering to help tidy up by vacuuming. I told him no I want to do it myself and he kept saying why. I said to him you had your chance to help tidy up in the first place and you failed so I would rather do it on my own. Now, I’m so irritated to the point that every little thing would make me snap at him. 

Long story short, he got me really mad and I put my hands on him, punching kicking, pushing and throwing things at him(apparently made him bleed). I wanted him to leave my home immediately and he wouldn’t so I took his headphones that I brought him till he left and he threatened to throw my ps4 down my 3 flight of stairs apartment even though I lie for it ( he paid off his card and I gave him the cash) I rang my friend to collect me as I literally wanted to pull a knife on him. My mood was very psychotic and if my friend never came in time I would of been in custody or being charged of murder.

The craziest thing is I don’t regret my actions yet he still wants to be with me and I don’t know why. I want to leave him simplify for his safety and I don’t want to hurt him again because I know I’m more than capable. I really don’t know what to do and I’m really depressed. I literally the same day booked a flight to Jamaica to get away and I’m here in Jamaica reminiscing about the whole event. Please help me, I feel like a monster and I feel as if I need to be alone forever ","The expanded size of the tensor (548) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.

"Bates motel and BPD I have always been a fan of horror movies/shows, so of course I thought I would give bates motel a try.

"therapy/treatment issues (mainly not being in it) [long, need advice] so i've been in and out of treatment for a really long time, but most recently (june of last year) a really traumatizing thing happened to me where my therapist (who i was really basically obsessive and codependent with but loved) suddenly broke and decided that she couldn't see me anymore. she said it was because she realized she wasn't good for me and that i was moving soon, but basically i couldn't find a different therapist and things started devolving and before i tried to kill myself, i tried to call her and express my suicidal thoughts and she just told me on the phone that she wasn't my therapist anymore and she couldn't help me. tl;dr i spent 6 weeks in the hospital, got out, moved across the state and started school 10 days after. fast forward to now, where things have stabilized, i have a psychiatrist, haven't done therapy, tried but was too triggered from my past experience, and things have devolved again where the depression and suicidal thoughts are really really bad, somewhat associated with current life, very associated with my still-very-alive fixation about how my ex-therapist abandoned me.
don't know what to do. in the past, have been told that it's really difficult for me to seek outpatient treatment because i'm generally not stable enough to get into deep issues and not totally decompensate, but residential facilities are very expensive and insurance had issues covering them. i had a few short res stays (&lt;2 weeks) and a few longer inpatient stays (4-6 weeks) but obviously inpatient isn't ideal for like, therapy, and again, residential is crazy expensive and also BPD specialized ones are often private pay.
my ex-therapist was like, a special case because we actually got through some of my issues, but it was at the level of her talking to me on the phone 3-4 times a week (almost every day), often taking emergency calls on weekends or in the middle of the night, plus seeing her in person weekly. she would let me leave her voicemails when i would be feeling bad, and it would be like several a day, every day (i know i am literally a terrible person). in the dark months i would try to OD on stuff like, weekly, usually ~24 hours after therapy, and i barely got through it with extensive help from her.
it was def not an ideal situation, and there's no way i could replicate that situation even if she still existed because i couldn't sustain that level of functioning at the new school i'm at. also, i don't have her anymore. also, i don't want to be so close to someone else ever again because that ""breakup"" ruined me in several ways that i don't ever care to experience again.
but ... i probably need therapy. am traumatized, having PTSD signs, BARELY controlled by a ton of medication. my psychiatrist agrees that we can hold off on thinking about therapy until i'm more stabilized on meds currently cuz this right now is a more recent dip. but i don't know what kind of therapy treatment i need?

on one hand, not delving into the issues grants me a sufficient level of functioning to be in school, albeit i have many horrible days like this where i cry in bed and think about suicide.
on the other hand, theoretically fixing my issues would give me a better life.
on the other other hand, outpatient treatment didn't seem to work and probably would do more harm than good (methinks) if it wasn't, like, super intensive (but also... that's unrealistic).
on the other other other hand, i suck at groups (ex: IOP, PHP) and they always kick me out bc i'm SUPER borderline and somehow manipulate the group dynamic in a bad way (i know i do this, but honestly never realize til it's too late, i'm just a really bad person guys) so that's why we went with individual therapy previously.
also, i have already taken a medical leave previously and it didn't help, i ended up in PHP/res/IOP for a lot of it and it wasn't super helpful because it was too much me getting involved with other people instead of working on myself. i also kind of devolved with all the extra time i had on my hands for not being in school. so i don't think taking another leave would be helpful in the least.
residential i honestly think could be helpful, but i never got an honest shot at it and also, crazy expensive.

*tl;dr it seems that not doing therapy and numbing myself with (prescribed) benzos is the path of least harm right now, but has no long term improvement, but the options of trying to do therapy and get better seems kind of a toss up in terms of effectiveness and would also probably make me deteriorate even more. if i got better in the long run, theoretically it's worth it, but i've tried a lot of stuff before and it didn't help so i don't want to take the risk. also, i'm poor, and a really bad person, and maybe unfixable (or unwilling, idk)*","The expanded size of the tensor (1098) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.

"There is no day where I didn't feel like I want to kill myself. I want to kill myself right now so bad This really unbearable. I just can't have any kind of an interpersonal relationship without ruining it and then ruining myself for ruining it. and that is only one problem. The most persistent and annoying one though. I am so tired of this emotional swings throughout the day, and everyday. Every time I feel emotional I can't stop thinking about dying in the most extreme shocking way and see people's faces, how will they react to it. It's almost like I don't really want to die.  But I want them to have an excessive emotional experience out of my death. There is a lot and a lot. and it's getting worse and worse. I honestly feel it's getting worse each day. In fact, it has always been ""the worst"". I never know what being ""relaxed"" is, I am always dwelling very deep in my emotions. I am always restless and irritated. it sucks

Edit: no one become my friend, and actually STAYS my friend. I either sexualize the relationship by jumping on anyone (I am a man), and if I can't I become very emotional with those people and start telling them too much, then their friendship suddenly diminish! and when they go, I start to think of ways to make sure they suffer as well. i start hating them from all my heart, then with the very first nice thing they do they suddenly become the best old friend, then they become hated by me. it's freaking me out, because i no longer know what I feel about anyone anymore. The same people can seems nice and I feel like I am glad I met them turn to be evil and obnoxious minutes after that or days or the opposite. I don't know if I am thinking too much through things, and thats how people normally feel and think. I am not diagnosed yet with any personality disorder. I started going to therapy two months ago or so. And I am mentioning those symptoms a lot to see if my therapist would talk about BPD or not, but he wouldn't, however, he asked me ponce a question which I knew he is getting information for that from it. BUT, now I feel like I am deceiving my therapist. I am telling the truth, but I am intentionally focusing on BPD symptoms. However, I stopped doing that for two weeks now.
I am tired. Today I wished that ""my friend"", one of the few people I considered as a friend once, to die SO bad. I hated and hated every wove ad every word from him. I started to be iffy with him as I am now feeling like he is a trash ad he doesn't need my respect.

"DAE see traits of abusive exes in new men? A few years back I dated a man who was pretty physically and sexually abusive towards me, and it really stuck with me for a while. It happened when I was 17, and since then I've worked really hard to move on from it and to regain a healthy sex life, and I'm proud of that. I don't have flashbacks anymore and I'm able to have sex without feeling scared or hurt, but I'm still having one problem. Every time I start seeing someone new, all I can see are traits of my abusive ex. Not traits that were abusive, just general ways they speak or joke or even smell (weirdly enough) that remind me of my ex and make me feel really uneasy around them. I've started seeing this new guy and I'm really into him and he's been nothing but great to me, and I have no reason to believe he'd ever do anything abusive. But something about him just reminds me of the non abusive part of my exes personality, and it makes me want to run. Does anyone else experience this?

Feel free to be as general or specific as possible.

"Next time I'm suicidal, I'm keeping that shit to myself. I was released from a psych hospital about a month ago. I was in for maybe 72 hours. They didn't fuck with my meds. They pretty much did nothing but let me work my own shit out. In that time I lost my house, my job and all of my friends. I was evicted from my sober living for ""disruptive behavior"". I was never, not once, violent or agressive. I never broke curfew. I did my chores. I didn't break a single rule. But I guess being suicidal is enough to get evicted and not get your deposit back. My job hired 2 new people in my place while I was gone. To answer some common questions: No, I am not crazy. Well, I'm a little crazy, but that doesn't make me any less of a human. Yes, I really did want to die. Yes, I want to die most of the time. Yes, I am stable. This is as good as it gets. No, I'm not going to kill you in your sleep. The only person I ever wanted to hurt was myself.
Now everywhere I look, people are making suicide jokes. I've had people tell me that I should have done it (""jokingly"") and I've had people tell me that they didn't feel the least bit sorry for me. Everyone has an opinion, and all of them are fucked. I'm viewed as weak, unstable, a lost cause, a cry for attention. And people are very vocal about all of this. Almost makes me wish I'd done it, you know?
I'm reminded that this is why I don't have friends. Because people are shitstains about this kind of stuff. I'm reminded why I don't speak to my family, who pretty much told me ""lol good luck"" when I got out of the hospital with nowhere to go. I should mention I'm 19 in a city I've never been in with no car and now no job. 
So next time I'm suicidal (and there will be an next time, this was not an isolated incident), my lips are fucking zipped. I'm not telling anyone shit. Not my friends, not my roommates, not my family, not my psych, and I'm sure as hell not calling 911 like I did last time. I'll work that shit out on my own. Yeah, the stigma sucks, but it's DEFINITELY there and not going away any time soon. I've always been pretty open about my bp. Not anymore. I'll deal with it on my own.

"Scared. Hi guys. 
I haven’t been diagnosed with BPD. I haven’t been to my GP in over a year about anything. I may not even have BPD, I know self diagnoses doesn’t work. I’m sorry if this is the wrong place to post this. 

But I follow this subreddit very closely, and I fit all the characteristics of someone with this illness and I just wanted to post this somewhere because I feel like I’m about to explode.

I’m so scared, all the time. I’ve pushed  almost everyone away from myself in these last 6 months as I can’t cope with the emotional whirlwind of being friends with people and relying on them, it’s too much. I spend my time switching between loving these people and then getting terrified that they’re going to leave me and never talk to me again. So I get angry that they’re going to leave me and I stop talking to them, then I feel so crippling lonely that I’m alone in this world. 

I spend my days putting on a happy face at work and coming home and just lying in my dark room, thinking and mentally torturing myself. I moved back home to my parents about a year ago, as I was going through a shit time where I was living before, constantly drinking my paycheque away. I was self harming at the time, and had been just engaging in reckless selfish behaviour all the time. I didn’t want to be that person anymore, so I moved back in with my parents. It was okay for the first couple of months, I wasn’t drinking as much, only with friends on nights out. But these past 6-9 months I’ve just gone downhill even further. 

I’m drinking and driving, I’m taking drugs, I seem to have no control over my behaviour. I do all this stupid stuff just because I feel so empty, like when you’re really hungry and your stomach hurts? That but in my mind, it’s constant. I spend the day after these ‘benders’ so ashamed and filled with guilt, I can’t even look at myself.

Now that I’m back with my parents and siblings as well, I’ve ‘latched’ onto them. I’m so scared they’re going to leave me because they hate me.

"Scared. Hi guys. 
I haven’t been diagnosed with BPD. I haven’t been to my GP in over a year about anything. I may not even have BPD, I know self diagnoses doesn’t work. I’m sorry if this is the wrong place to post this. 

But I follow this subreddit very closely, and I fit all the characteristics of someone with this illness and I just wanted to post this somewhere because I feel like I’m about to explode.

I’m so scared, all the time. I’ve pushed  almost everyone away from myself in these last 6 months as I can’t cope with the emotional whirlwind of being friends with people and relying on them, it’s too much. I spend my time switching between loving these people and then getting terrified that they’re going to leave me and never talk to me again. So I get angry that they’re going to leave me and I stop talking to them, then I feel so crippling lonely that I’m alone in this world. 

I spend my days putting on a happy face at work and coming home and just lying in my dark room, thinking and mentally torturing myself. I moved back home to my parents about a year ago, as I was going through a shit time where I was living before, constantly drinking my paycheque away. I was self harming at the time, and had been just engaging in reckless selfish behaviour all the time. I didn’t want to be that person anymore, so I moved back in with my parents. It was okay for the first couple of months, I wasn’t drinking as much, only with friends on nights out. But these past 6-9 months I’ve just gone downhill even further. 

I’m drinking and driving, I’m taking drugs, I seem to have no control over my behaviour. I do all this stupid stuff just because I feel so empty, like when you’re really hungry and your stomach hurts? That but in my mind, it’s constant. I spend the day after these ‘benders’ so ashamed and filled with guilt, I can’t even look at myself.

Now that I’m back with my parents and siblings as well, I’ve ‘latched’ onto them. I’m so scared they’re going to leave me because they hate me. I think they’re going to die and leave me on my own everyday. I can’t listen to the local news anymore or read about traffic accidents because I’m scared that it’s my family in it. I text my mum all the time, asking where she is. I’ve even developed a ritual where I have to touch my heart and then my head if I ever have a bad thought about one of them not being okay.

"In loving memory of sloane Sullivan Sloane was my most recent favorite person. She was my best friend, she called me hers too. We used to get fancy coffee together, make art, explore the world and explore the ideas of what it meant to contribute kindness to the world in an impactful way. She was a proud, fearless trans woman, until the end. She helped all of our friends examine who they were and why whatever they were was ok, and why they should be proud of that. Sloane was an incredibly accomplished computer programmer. She made apps that I can hardly grasp the function of as someone who isn't computer savvy. She was the first trans employee of jump trading and taught the company so much about diversity. She would have been 23 the day before yesterday. She killed her self on November 11th. Her dying wish was for as much good as possible to come from her passing. If you can, please donate to the center on Halstead in Chicago, in her honor. Even if it's just a dollar, it would mean the world to people like her and to me. Her dad volunteers there now, and she was recently memorialized in their memorial garden for influential LGBT people. 

I'm completely lost without her. What do you do when the person responsible for your survival and will to live is gone forever?

"DAE get obsessive over things for months on end? 
For example, one day, I'll think about getting rats. So I research rats. (so far, so fine) then I'll keep researching rats. I think about rats all the time. I contact rat groups and people with rats. I spend 4 hours each evening researching rats and rat stuff and chatting in forums about rats. Finally, I am convinced I want to get rats. I research best cages, (for months), buy a cage. Research what substrate and bedding to use etc etc at the same time. Finally I contact breeders about rats. Lots of breeders. I get rats.

Then I get them home and think 'fuck, what have I done?' and feel instant regret.
It's like splitting from whatever I was obsessed about. 

Any ideas on how to escape this?

I think I'm doing the same thing with greyhounds and the last thing I want to do is get a dog if it's an obsession and not a reasoned, actual want at the moment.

And I can't tell the difference between obsession and actually liking something. 

Totally fallen for a lovely hound, been researching and searching for months, but what if I don't actually want one and it's just an obsession again?

"Does anyone else feel the most paralyzing neediness literally every second of the day and nothing can ever make it go away for long? A few people distract me for a bit.  If there is someone I can be obsessed with, that's the best way to fill the void. But it's not easy to find someone I have any feelings for. pretty rare now actually.  And what I find stimulating might not be what I NEED or is good for me either... :S  

And the neediness doesn't go away. It literally hurts me so much I want to kill myself for it to end.  Meditating doesn't help. Nothing helps.  I don't even know what I need, it's like stimulation from a certain kind of person that I'm desperate for...... 

It's this void that most people can't fill though, and so I just wait in such pain, like a withdrawing drug addict, hoping to connect to SOMEONE who might distract me from how awful I feel every second.

"Difference between letting things go and being a push over? I dealt with a build up of trying events/things that upset me over a couple a weeks by scribbling them down on a piece of paper and ripping it up. It actually worked and I moved on from it and now I can't even remember what it was that I wrote down. However, I'm finding it hard to differentiate between insignificant things that can be let go and things that are more serious and should be addressed. Even just little things in the relationship that are insignificant on their own, are actually a huge red flags for something more sinister. I'm worried that if I repeat what I did, scribble it down, rip it up and forget it, that in a few years time I'll kick myself because they were warning signs that I didn't pay heed to or that's caused a build up of resentment because it wasn't addressed at the time. Some of these things keep popping up again and again and upsetting me. I don't know whether it would be nothing or a deal breaker to the average person. I just don't know what's right and what's wrong and whether I'm just being a push over and used. This has really upset me.

"*for vent* weird dreams, memories and thoughts *may be triggering* hey all, i'm diagnosed with impulsive bpd since 2014 but did not get psychological or medical treatment since then unfortunately. (my parents which i live with and that pay my health insurance say i don't need it and that i'm just a burden for people with ""real"" diseases and the doctors/nurses, so i'm going to wait until i can afford it myself - srsly, trouble's not worth it, argumented for years with them.)

i'm 23 now and lately i've had some strange dreams and memories of childhood abuse; i'm 99% sure they're real as i did some strange sexual things as a young kid like masturbating in kindergarten/class and stuff like that. since that a few later sexual assaults i forgot about came back into my mind, i feel so awful and can't sleep. i told my mum about the later incidents (not the one as a kid since she would not believe it or if she would, she would freak out) and she just said it was not so bad. don't get me wrong, she cares about me and loves me, but she's strange about mental diseases and says i'm fine as i already mentioned. since these memories the bpd striked double again and if i do not hurt myself i have such an anger for others it's not bearable. the coping mechanics i learned 2014 in the hospital like taking cold showers do not work... i feel like i can't even do a job atm when all the feelings take over me and those strange memories/flashbacks...

just needed a place to vent, but if anyone has advice i would be thankful. thanks for reading","[[{'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.4252486526966095}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.2474873661994934}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.04763730242848396}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.0400068461894989}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.0385633185505867}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.03757704049348831}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.026673192158341408}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.0222739540040493}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.02153817191720009}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.0207589790225029}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.017539680004119873}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.01741938106715679}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.01562212873250246}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.01370448712259531}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.010139902122318745}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.00931314006447792}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.006654634140431881}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.006647419650107622}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.005098942667245865}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.004562580492347479}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.002931022085249424}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.002389092929661274}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.00184006174094975}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.0018311109161004424}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.001233834307640791}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.001218231045641005}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0008975608507171273}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.00082242744974792}]]"
"I have a boyfriend I care about and I'm falling for our mutual friend who also has BPD It's such a messy situation down to how I even met these two guys, but right now my boyfriend is in a treatment facility and I'm at another facility with our mutual friends.

Logically, my boyfriend wins. I know he cares about me deeply. That he loves me sooooo much. He's the type of man I'd like to marry and have kids with, but in this strange turn of events he clings to ME, he's always worried about ME leaving him. It's like my years of being borderline and driving people crazy are being flipped and smashed into my face by this man who isn't diagnosed but who was strongly thought to have BPD or bipolar

It's weird and I can't make sense of my emotions. When I'm with my boyfriend visiting him and facetiming him, I'm sooooo connected to him and feel passionately for him. But that's all we get. Our friend on the other hand, I'm with every day. I've started to emotionally cheat. :( I never knew I could become this person or ever be in this situation.

Our friend and I are super close. When we were all together before my bf had to leave, I would hug our friend and call him my puppy, and he even gave me massages when my bf was right there. We were all close. With my bf gone things have shifted.

My boyfriend started getting more and more paranoid about every interaction I have with anything male and it started pushing me from him. I confided in our friend. Eventually he couldn't help himself and confessed to me that he thinks my bf is too immature for a relationship and he would be better for me, that he always liked me. I've also grown feelings for him.

I'm so conflicted. I don't want to leave my bf. The thought makes me sick. But at the same time the thought of being with him and just him forever makes me sick. Nothing about being with our friend makes me sick *right now*. It's like all of our disorders are  melding into this bomb that's going to explode. Our friend has completely turned on my boyfriend in his absence when we all became friends together. He has a new best bro around (who also knows my bf) that's constantly calling my bf a douche now because they've heard how often my bf just blows up on me if I'm laughing in the presence of a male. They actually were HYSTERICAL over calling my boyfriend being pissed at me when I didn't call him by a certain time because I was with them playing ping pong and knowing everything he was going to say. They started mocking him and shaking their heads because I was sad, and it was horrible. I don't know if I'm truly losing interest in my boyfriend or if I'm just splitting right now because our friend is around everyday hugging me and being sweet to me and just giving me positive attention so I'm idealizing him. Or if he's truly better for me. It feels like we might just be bouncing around in a BPD initial love fog that would clear into nothingness. There's so much mental with my bf, the planning, the concreteness of what we want. Yet so much *vibe* with our friend.

My head is in a fog. I can't separate logic from all this BPD absurdity. Help. :(

P.S. I'm a piece of shit.","The expanded size of the tensor (739) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.  Target sizes: [1, 739].  Tensor sizes: [1, 514]"
"Ever feel like your SO and family would just be better off without you? Diagnosed BPD almost a year ago. Partner and I have been married 8 years and have two kids. Last year I had 3 hospital stays in a month for suicidal ideation/urges/etc. We moved states to be closer to family support in the event something happens with me again. I have been going to DBT groups consistently, seeing my counselor consistently, taking my medication consistently, and overall trying to manage myself.

Last year after a difficult fight between us, she said she would have left me if she could, but didn’t feel like she could financially support herself/the kids without me. I also found her reading “Why Does He Do That?”, a book for victims of abusive partners. 

Fast forward to this year and she has finished her degree, had her criminal record expunged (won’t show up on background checks), and has a really good job with a large company and she is doing really well there. She would do just fine without me in the picture (child support, life insurance, etc.). She also has recognized that she has let go of her codependent tendencies.

Here’s the thing. I think she would be better off without me. My emotions are not consistent, I don’t have very many days where I’m super happy. She comes home from work with so many stories about the fun things that happened at work with her and her coworkers. She isn’t codependent anymore like I still am. I rely on her perception of me for my own perception of myself while she has now broken free and is independently happy. 

I know she has stayed with me but I do feel like she’d be happier without me bringing her down at home. She could enjoy life instead of being my caretaker and putting up with my shit. 

Does anyone else ever feel this way about their SO?","[[{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.3117556571960449}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.1986164003610611}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.11305730789899826}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.043821826577186584}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.04264908656477928}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.03396305441856384}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.030200723558664322}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.026288241147994995}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.02415630593895912}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.016333185136318207}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.01617344468832016}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.015185168944299221}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.014422914944589138}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.00672230776399374}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.005515052936971188}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.00517905643209815}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.005114044528454542}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.004530554171651602}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.003454383695498109}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.003015445312485099}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0022987767588347197}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.001862644567154348}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.0016660048859193921}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.0016597653739154339}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.0010041972855105996}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.0008472064509987831}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.0006475096452049911}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.00041476779733784497}]]"
"Here to give back Hey guys ♡ there's been many a time I've come here either for opinions, general advice, or literal saving (a couple of you may remember back in December I was contemplating suicide...and a few wonderful people talked me off the ledge).  I wanted to thank all of you so much for your support and company. 

Also, I'd like to return the favor.

I do work overnights so I keep weird hours, but as long as I'm awake and this post is up, I want to hear from you.  ""But Capy we have a discord for this"" - yes and it's a fantastic place...but some people are intimidated by the 'group' setting.

"Drunken word, sober thoughts? Okay, long story short.
Night starts off with a little light drinking with some people I consider close friends (known for roughly 10 years).

As of recent, I notice that every time I would get tipsy-drunk my mindset of the people who I am with. I get the sense that they are evil and cannot be trusted like some sort of conspiracy 1984. I know whatever I’m thinking is crazy and I should try to not puke and just dance the night away.

Roughly 3 hrs pass, I’m just jumping on the dance floor. I get tired, and reach for my phone. Lol
To pass the time, I look at my phone and look through my group chats, with friends, families and etc and I notice a pattern in their text.

As I read each and every single text from my friends and families. I see the their true intentions which is evil and they cannot be trusted and it’s all a masquerade!

The next morning I wake up after the night in my own bed and go into my sisters room to yell at her for something she did to me the week before.

I think I should stop drinking, thoughts?
I usually just drink once a month and go hard but not to the point of lying on the ground that requires me to be carried away.
The only time I get these crazy thoughts is when I’m drinking. While sober I don’t think like this.","[[{'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.879974365234375}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.12714627385139465}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.12169579416513443}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.07613110542297363}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.05816430598497391}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.03879177197813988}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.019054679200053215}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.014831111766397953}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.012807526625692844}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.010237348265945911}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.009023310616612434}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.008940125815570354}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.008758551441133022}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.0075063882395625114}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.007218916900455952}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.006812685169279575}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.00605002511292696}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.004281291272491217}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.004253881983458996}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.003916783723980188}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.003462993772700429}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.002342687686905265}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.002315121702849865}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.0019193378975614905}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.0014391286531463265}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.0012694908073171973}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.001029566046781838}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.0008069652249105275}]]"

Remembering random things from the past I had a terrible and traumatic childhood and adolescence. How I’ve tried to cope with things is by pretending they didn’t happen and trying hard to forget them. In the past year or so I’ve just had random terrible memories come back to me.

"Empathy sometimes switches off, especially when comforting someone else Does anyone else get this? I can't figure out if it's dissociation or something else. When I google it all I can really find is stuff about people voluntarily turning their empathy on and off. 

Sometimes when I'm talking to someone who's upset and comforting them, like even a friend I really care about crying in my arms, I just ... don't care? It doesn't usually happen in the middle of comforting someone, it either happens at the start of the interaction/when they start getting upset, or it doesn't. 

During those moments I'm totally acting. I don't care, but I know that normal me cares and that being comforting is the right thing to do, so I act. In my head I'm literally thinking ""I don't care"" and internally rolling my eyes and thinking ""oh great, here we go again."" But I know the things the person needs to hear, so I'll say them and sound convincing and reassuring. 

It's usually accompanied by mild annoyance at the other person's emotions. I feel like they're being melodramatic, or I'm annoyed that I have to be dealing with their emotions. I'm thinking about how I'd rather be watching a TV show or be on reddit. Dealing with and managing the other person feels like a chore.  

It's not all the time. Usually I really do feel empathy, and I'm genuinely hurting for the other person and I genuinely care about their feelings and wellbeing and I'm experiencing emotions and compassion during something like this.

"Best way to break it off with pwBPD, do I go for the closure talk? Was friends with a pwBPD for years. Ended up dating them for a while. I get the sense from the way she treats me that she lost interest/has another target already but doesn't want to be the one to break it off for the usual reasons. So she's doing the slow fade thing, taking really long to reply, stopped arranging to meet etc. Which would be the ideal situation, except that I actually care about the friendship that we had, and as far as possible I want to minimize the fallout from mutual friends and family. Should I 1) do the slow fade thing as well? 2) actually have a closure talk (hey, it's clearly not working out, you're no longer interested etc.) I want this to end on as amicable terms as it is possible with a pwBPD.

"Reconnecting with BPD friend A good friend of mine has BPD, and she's recently begun to devalue me. I'm not sure exactly when it began or for what reason, but we ""stopped being friends"" about two weeks ago. I don't view it as being my fault, and I don't resent her for it. I'm prepared for the possibility of us never reconnecting, but I don't believe that the situation warrants completely severing our ties and never talking with each other again. I do my best to be a loyal friend regardless of circumstance, and I think this is something that her illness is making her do, not a reflection of how she feels when her thought process is more sober and rational. 


In the beginning, I was hurt by her sudden dislike for me, but after I've had some time to remove myself from the situation and think about it, I don't blame myself. At the moment, she has no power over how I view myself or if I'm happy or depressed, I just view her as a friend with an illness who I want to help.

"Guy just friendzoned me and I completely split So I’ve been planning to hang out with this guy for a few days now after we started talking and hit it off. We decided to get pizza and hike a trail today and I actually wasn’t too excited (not as excited as I used to be) since DBT has helped me not intensify my emotions, but I was stoked nonetheless since all my friends left campus and I’ve been pretty lonely. 

I’m looking for a relationship and being a gay guy...it’s hard. So I saw this as a potential relationship. He’s sweet and charming and he has an attractive personality. Well today he says “Oh just a heads up before we hang out, I’m only looking for a friendship right now”

"How do you/loved ones calm you during a BPD ""episode""? I've been diagnosed with BPD, PTSD &amp; Anxiety for the past 7 years, no depression according to my therapists. Currently unmedicated.

Well, the past weekend I triggered myself into BPD+Anxiety ""episode"" due to being a dumb-ass, fun stuff. The whole ""episode"" didnt last long, 2-2 and a half days, and my partner was with me the whole time. It was the first ""episode"" he was with me from start to finish, and he tried his best but nothing helped me until it just passed on its own. In the past I would end up harming myself to quiet the emotional pain, and thats the only thing that helped to bring me back to reality. He said it was impossible to communicate with me since I was so shut down, and simple phrases like: ""I love you"", ""I'm here with you, I wont abandon you"", ""You're amazing and beautiful"" - just seem to aggravate and make me spin even deeper into self loathing and abandonment anxiety. Distraction also didn't work, since my head is so chaotic and its impossible for me to consentrate on anything but the voices in my head. We tried to talk about what was going on inside me, what I was feeling and thinking, and it didnt go so well either, since in my mind he was the enemy at that time. So he just ended up being physically there for me, embracing me, holding my hand and let me cry as much as I needed. 

I wanted to know, when your BPD is acting up (and high anxiety), is there anything that helps you sooth yourself and get out from ""that state""? Is there anything your partner/friends/family do that help you? I didn't find anything on the topic through google honestly, and the BPD stigma most article host just kills me.","[[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.3956567347049713}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.33944037556648254}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.19463194906711578}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.07916123420000076}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.07636909186840057}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.0722084641456604}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.06381890177726746}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.061868540942668915}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.04676215350627899}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.03659574314951897}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.031397588551044464}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.02671244367957115}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.02579750493168831}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.012274367734789848}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.01194865070283413}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.011018755845725536}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.010751207359135151}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.009498575702309608}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.009443330578505993}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.006718713790178299}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.00638623908162117}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.00457047438248992}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.004348323214799166}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.004227546509355307}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.004082402680069208}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.001736588659696281}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.0011003095423802733}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.0007306739571504295}]]"

"Afraid my impulsiveness is going to ruin what I built. Long story short, I've been clean for over 2 and a half years. I was an addict, I smoked crack (freebase) to the point I lost a high paying media job (funny enough I was taught how to cook up a sheet by my boss), burnt many bridges and ruined MANY friendships.

 After this firing, I started a quick and incredibly serious downward spiral for almost 4 months straight of constantly smoking coke and floating from couch to couch, effectively homeless with no belongings. One day my impulsiveness kicked in (the one time I'm incredibly happy it did) and I basically sobered up for long enough to sell the last thing I owned (laptop) and bought a bus ticket to the other side of the country to start again.

Now this was incredibly stupid of me. I have always moved without a plan and it's rarely ever worked out, often times ending with me losing my belongings (or selling) and begging people for a place to stay.

But somehow this time was different and I hit the lucky universe lottery. I got clean, got a great job again, replaced everything I ever sold of mine and then some (video games, tvs, built a great pc), met the love of my life and moved in together and we have a dog. Simple stuff but I was so proud to have my shit in order once again.

But my illness would still show it's face, but mind you it was manageable as I had a mental health team and finally seemed to be on the right meds.

But I always had the want to pick up and move as I was unhappy with how lonely I have become out here as my only friends are my girlfriend's bestfriends, which doesn't do the trick when you just want to have a beer or dinner and shoot the shit with a buddy. Namely your own buddy.

Well somewhere along the line, I couldn't make my appointments because of work hours, then that turned into ""can't make my appointments cause fuck my appointments"". That meant no script, no meds. 

That turned into quitting my job packing my stuff up buying a plane ticket and convincing my girlfriend that we should move (albeit she is coming down 2 months after me) some how she's super excited about it. I don't think she understands how out of control this is, and I dont really wanna let her know as she will have a heart attack.

So now I have mailed all my stuff across the country, found a new job there (don't know how I managed that one) and a new apt, I am fucked though and I am the only one who knows this. I am terrified that I am capable of making such rash decisions, I did not plan this out. I bought a ticket and just assumed shit would fall into place. I am so tired of living like this, my life was so good and I ruined it. 

I dont know what to do. I can't get my job I quit back, and my girlfriend isnt quite aware of how ""by the seat of my pants"" this is, no one is.

I don't wanna get more impulsive, sell my shit and some how end up smoking crack again.

I don't know what to do.","The expanded size of the tensor (692) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.  Target sizes: [1, 692].  Tensor sizes: [1, 514]"
"off work with crippling anxiety I made a friend at my old job who moved away to Canada last year, and I've been out to visit him since, and things developed to more than friends, and we recently just took a 2 week trip together. We got back to our different sides of the world and he has pretty much ghosted me. Knowing my background, my BPD diagnosis, how I handle assumed rejection, I'm pretty taken aback that he has done this to me.

We talked things out before we left each other about how a relationship probably wouldn't work with us living on seperate sides of the planet but I was struggling with it when I got home and tried to pick up my life which hasn't really worked for me, I'm really depressed and I tired to talk this through with him but he just told me not to wallow. He sent me an email last night explaining why he's dropped off and stopped talking to me, that I've had a huge impact and the powerful connection he's made with me but then said he doesn't want to hang onto it and explore, as the timing is not right, but maybe, if and when we're in the same place and time but not now. He sent this just as I was about to go to sleep (there's an 8 hour time difference) so obviously, because I've been feeling totally rejected and the abandonment issues are at the forefront I didn't sleep, had a panic attack, had to take additional medication, and now feel really ill, feel like I have the flu and was unable to get to work this morning. I'd spent most of the weekend in bed, and on my own, (not there was anyone to talk to) but I was hoping I could start the week fresh and was trying to be positive. I'm trying to handle this rationally, trying to not to let the usual behaviours creep in, trying not to push but I'm falling apart here, I don't know what's wrong with me. I deleted all social media, his number, the email, any messages I had from him, I've cried a lot, and I guess writing here in an attempt not to split so dramatically because I don't want to lash out, I have done that already whilst he was ignoring me. I don't know what to do, I thought I had a handle on all this.

"DAE downplay their symptoms on unconsciously? Therapist saying I don't make any sense I've been on and off therapy for years and I've always lied to all my therapist and psychs. I've been told I'm hard to treat and I know it but this time I really want to get help. I've never been formally diagnosed, but bpd is written all over my file, except I never stayed for long enough to be diagnosed. I know I have BPD, I've had time to accept it and knowing helps me feel less inadequate and alone, it makes things make sense but nothing I've told my therapist and psych makes sense to them. They want to diagnose me soon (I'm sitting a few tests this week and next week) and today my therapist told me my mental illnesses make no sense to her because there seems to be no reason for me to have developped them which is why she's sure it's a PD thing, but she already told me she doesn't know how to treat me or if she can. I'm scared and frustrated because I'm trying this time, I'm being honest but I'm also confused by my behaviour and I don't know how to explain it. She told me I'm like two different people in one brain (behaviour vs logical reasoning) and I'm so scared they're gonna diagnose me with yet another m.i. She says a part of me is doing everything for attention, yet I hide all of my symptoms and basically she can't read me AT ALL. I know I downplay my symptoms a lot because I'm used to hiding my problems , she also said I'm dowplaying how maladapted I am and I'm always trying to be different and I don't know how to take it because I know I'm really sick but I can't help but pretend I'm completely healthy.

"I'm done. I don't know what to do. I want to be dead. I ruin everything. I just want my girlfriend to love me, but how could she? I abuse her when she didn't do anything wrong. She says that when I get angry she's afraid that I'm going to hit her. I feel like all I do is try to work on this and manage it, and I still can't. Slow Improvement isn't enough. I'm still a worthless human being. We had such a good weekend, but I had to ruin it. She said she wanted to make a fun photo collage for Instagram of the good time we had this weekend, but now it's ruined. The memory of the weekend is ruined. I ruin so many good memories.

"Jealousy with a favorite person First and foremost, sorry for my bad English it’s not my first language. My favorite person is someone I am extremely close with and we tend to share every detail of our lives with one another. A fact that he admits he only does with me, which I love a great deal. He is has his own set of issues that I won’t talk about here since I’m paranoid he will find this thread somehow. We help each other deal with our issues by being open and honest with one another and I try to be completely and utterly supportive of him otherwise I’m sure he will leave me. Issue is, since he shares everything with me he also tends to espouse feelings of love and admiration for his other friends and potential romantic partners. I want to be as supportive as possible and I give him advice as much as I can but whenever he puts other people on a pedestal I feel immensely jealous and hurt because a big part of me thinks it somehow cuts into the love he gives me. I feel like I don’t even come close to those other people he loves and that he love them more than me. I overanalyze all the details about his other close friends can convince myself that a simple word/sentence or even something he does for them somehow justifies in my mind that he loves them more. If he ever expresses his love for one of his friends I’ll hang onto those words for months on end and it drives me mad. He does show his love for me and routinely puts me on a pedestal too but if he ever does that for other people I can’t help but feel overcome with envy and jealously that I just can’t shake. I can’t tell him to stop because it would make me a worse friend since he would suddenly be unable to talk to me about everything. But on the other hand it makes me feel like shit since it makes the love he feels for me less special.

"Advice needed regarding work Hey everyone. 

I having problems sorting my emotions regarding my job. I've been trying some DBT techniques but I'm still very confused on how to feel.

I'm working a seasonal job so it's not essential for me, or my lifestyle. But I'm an advocate for my co-workers and am willing to go that extra step for them. Two months ago they needed an overnight associate so I accepted since everyone else had a family. That turned into 7 nights a week at 60+ hours. 

I justified working those hours by telling myself that it also benefitted me, even if I didn't necessarily want it. 1/3 of those hours are overtime after all.

Now the company wants to cut back cost and hours. So they don't want me working that much(45-49 hours now). But still asking me to work 7 days a week. 

I feel like I'm being taken advantage of by the higher-ups. I never wanted to work 7 days. 40 hours with two days off is world's better than 50hr with no time for myself.

Do you guys think I'm overreacting a little? I'm prone to overthink whenever there's a little bit of change. What would you all feel in that situation?

"About to lose it on my fiancé while at my dad's house My family loves him more than me. He's very shy and seldom speaks but he somehow becomes the center of attention in every social situation with my family. I honestly just want to leave him right now but I know that I'll feel different tomorrow. Maybe. 

I'm tired of everything being about him. He claims that he hates deciding things but apparently he loves it when it comes to my family. This was supposed to be my trip with my family. He's come down here with me before so it's not like this is anything new. I've pretty much been having a constant meltdown for the past 6 days and have been trying to hide it. It's come out a few times but otherwise I've managed it relatively okay given the circumstance. I just walk away, cry and throw things in private. 




Oh, and my dad told him that he should leave me because of how volatile I am (which is true, he really should leave) and then told me how I ruin everything.  So yeah, that's been my ""vacation"". I'm just coming up alone next time and spending the time with my grandma instead of my dad. She is the primary reason for me coming. I have a hard time trusting my fiancé while I'm away (even though he's literally done nothing to break my trust) but hey maybe my pent up anger and mistrust from when I get back will finally convince him to leave me.

"I've never been this desperate. How can I help my boyfriend get over my past BPD behaviors? For a tldr and the actual question go to the end of this post.

I thought things had been going amazing for a while, so did he.

We hardly ever fight anymore, things are mostly peaceful. It really did look like things were finally starting to get to a more healthy level for the 2 of us. (no srsly, read my  comments on BPDsoffa from the past few days and you'll see how good I thought it was right now as a reflection on his positive comments about us)

Right now he's in a different country. A holiday/work trip. After being there for about a week he started to get awfully sick again. It's the same sickness he had a year ago when he went to the same country. At first we thought it was the air polution, then we thought it was a food allergy, now it turns out it's a burn out caused by mental stress.

He has talked to a docter, a nurse and today (in a few hours) he'll be talking to the head of behavioral and relationships problems. It's an emergency call because they think he might have developed a disorder.

The first 2 already told him to break up with me. He's fearing for what the last one will say. Yes, he fears it. He sounded absolutely terrified of the possibility that this psychologist will tell him this because he really doesn't want to do it.
He wants us to work so badly and he wants to find a way to fix this but he doesn't know how to fix this toxic dynamic that has been created between us.

I no longer do most of the things that have caused him to get these issues and the few small remnant are mostly controled. I say this because I do feel like whatever it is that he'll need I can get myself to try and provide but neither of us knows what it is that he needs.

He apparently tried to distance himself before, tried to hang out with friends more as a way to do this but he feels like neither of these things helped. He doesn't believe that distance will solve the issue at all. He made that very clear to me by clearly stating so and constantly rejecting my suggestions of giving him more space and mostly just more control of his own life again.

I know there's some info out there on how to deal with these issues, but I don't know where to find them directly and the indirect places I know I don't think I should visit right now.

Tldr; my boyfriend is currently dealing with things like feeling terrified of not pleasing me 100% and feeling empty and not like himself caused by my past BPD behavior. What are the things I can do to help him and are there any resources available to help him with these issues?","The expanded size of the tensor (603) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.

"Recently diagnosed and doubting it now So I've thought for a while that I had BPD but I thought I could handle it myself. Like if i could teach myself DBT and focus on being mindful then I'd be fine. Spoiler alert it's not true and I'm finally getting help. I never mentioned BPD to my doctor or my therapist, but as soon as my psych eval was over I could tell what they were leaning towards. My therapist asked me about my sense of self,  talked about my black and white view of the world, my unstable relationships/emotions. It very quickly turned to talking about my ""emotional instability disorder"" and talked about starting DBT and possibly getting on some mood stabilizers to join up with the 50mg of Zoloft I'm on.

"Online Therapy Hi, I'm new to this sub so this may have been discussed elsewhere and, if so, I apologise. I was wondering if anyone here has tried online therapy? 

My current health insurance sucks and I have to pay out-of-pocket for everything until I meet a ridiculously high deductible. I can't switch insurances until November/December because *for some reason* that's the way things work in the US and I desperately need to start going to therapy again.

So, if anyone has tried online therapy could you tell me about your experience? Would you recommend it? How does DBT work in an online setting? 

Thanks","[[{'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.6026198267936707}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.40169739723205566}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.07581155747175217}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.07516977190971375}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.04478578642010689}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.032812997698783875}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.022773874923586845}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.02065012976527214}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.0199932511895895}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.01440457720309496}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.012514011934399605}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.011051284149289131}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.010543860495090485}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.009891299530863762}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.009393295273184776}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.007696605287492275}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.007691890466958284}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.005604530218988657}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.005299053620547056}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.005233985371887684}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.0036325212568044662}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.003524417756125331}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.0034328585024923086}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.0029324579518288374}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.0027505543548613787}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.0024230070412158966}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.0023612214718014}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.0003557479358278215}]]"
"Is there a way to get DBT in the UK? and has anyone actually recovered from BPD in this country? I've been to a lot of therapy since I was a child, and I've come to the conclusion that DBT is the only way I can get rid of this godforsaken bastard motherfucker of a soul sucking illness. I've been looking in to this since September, and it's not offered in my area on the NHS. I know there are a few (albeit extremely limited) private therapists who do it for around £150 - £200 p/h, but that's not the ""full"" DBT; as I think a huge part of DBT is also the group therapy, which isn't offered by any of the private therapists.
I'm slightly frustrated as I genuinely think I may need inpatient treatment as I'm sort of on an intense spiral atm; but inpatient treatment for BPD is only offered by GP referral if that, and it is soooo difficult to get refered to anything by the GP... Am I asking her the wrong questions or something?
Genuinely don't know what to do, and forgive the melodrama but I'm starting to lose hope. I really do think I need intensive treatment as this spiral is getting out of control; is there any hope for me?","[[{'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.4744943380355835}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.31257426738739014}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.28806403279304504}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.1727627068758011}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.13355696201324463}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.06963736563920975}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.05445379391312599}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.0381552129983902}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.03623791038990021}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.02089371532201767}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.02060304582118988}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.017290595918893814}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.012389968149363995}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.010890481993556023}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.008478089235723019}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.007533602882176638}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.005686909891664982}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.005534411408007145}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0053054471500217915}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.0036069038324058056}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.003250416135415435}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.0030867457389831543}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.0026875585317611694}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.0022280674893409014}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.00188472552690655}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.0011161009315401316}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.0006386893219314516}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.0004902604850940406}]]"
"Haven’t had sex or dated in over a year 28f 

Not sure how much context is necessary but essentially I got dumped last January, he emotionally cheated on me, he started dating someone else immediately, and he continuously gaslighted me. 

I’m very over him as a person but for the last year I feel like I don’t have the capacity to let someone new into my life just so that it can go shitty again. I also feel betrayed by love, something that I always had so much faith in as being the only thing I needed to be complete. 

However, I’d like to be able to just get laid and have fun but every time I have the opportunity to meet with someone I ghost them. I think I’ve ghosted at least 7 people recently. 

Has anyone ever been through something similar? Did you ever get over it? 

I have tried forcing myself to meet up with at least one person this week but I already feel like I’m just going to stop talking to her lol. 

I haven’t had an FP this whole time either. You’d think that not wanting to fill the void with meaningless sex and someone to be completely emotionally dependent on is good but I feel so empty and wrong. I almost feel like it’s worse to not be able to make these intense connections than to be dead inside because of a breakup.

"Living in a dull world. for the past month, I've found myself to be falling back into a low. its been getting worse as every day passes. I tried to quit smoking, where I went two days without a cigarette, but today I couldn't take it. I gave in and smoked about half of one to try to stabilize and bring myself back to reality.
everything has been so hard lately. I don't want to see anybody but I want them to care about me. but everyone seems to have something more important to do and just brush me off.
an example being that my friends told me to message them if I have troubles when quitting, and when I did so, I was told to ""just smoke since you're clearly not ready to quit."" 
anyway, people talking sounds like the way grownups talk in peanuts, everything is just white noise, I cant focus and my brain doesn't work, the world is becoming duller every day, and I've been so tired and dizzy lately. I'm not sure if this is the BPD since it seems like a different kind of low. this one seems more depressive but I'm not sure.
I have the urge to isolate myself and I've been taking those steps, not consciously but still. 
I just hope I figure out whats happening soon.

"My girlfriend left again and I don’t know how to cope In December me [21F] and my girlfriend [20F] broke up for over a month and it absolutely destroyed me. I went off on her in ways I’m absolutely ashamed of. Last week we managed to work things out but she left me again yesterday... I thought things were going great, in that time we didn’t fight at all. 

When she broke up with me this time she just said she didn’t think it’d work out and that she still loved me and that “I mean everything to her” still... then she threatened suicide and started saying things about how she only came back out of “obligation” when I was finally starting to cope with not having her in my life. It set me off again and I said some things I’m not proud of and she came back saying that the reason she couldn’t be with me was because I treat her like shit... every time we’ve been together I’ve always done everything to meet her needs and for the most part when I’m with her my BPD doesn’t “act up”.

I don’t know what to do anymore. She means the world to me and I’d do anything for her, I love her more than anyone and I’m attached to her more than I’ve ever been with anybody else. I don’t have any other friends or family, right now I’m just alone and scared and the thought of losing her forever again makes me want to jump off a bridge solely so I don’t have to deal with the pain.

"Destabilising once in a relationship Hey guys, long time redditor, short term lurker in this sub and first time poster, I’ll give more history at the end but just want to jump straight in for now.

When I’m single I find that I am better able to manage my emotions and focus on my goals, which is mainly study (trying to get into medical school) but as soon as I have a love interest it’s like anything I’ve been working toward suddenly goes on the back burner and I spend the majority of my time thinking about that person and wanting to spend time with them. I just lose any drive I did have about working toward my own personal goals. I also spend a lot of this time over analysing things they have said to me, for example panicking because they only sent one “x” at the end of their message or they had to leave early the last time we hung out. Only to have them be affectionate the next day and feel okay again.

Does anyone have any tips of how to stay focused and keep my emotions more steady? Like any checks I can keep in place?

A little bit of background I’m 23 and I’ve only been lurking on these forums lately as I’ve just finished DBT and I’m looking for some ongoing support, I’ve made a specific account for posting here as I’d rather people not know about my diagnosis. I was diagnosed 3 years ago and just finished one year of DBT.

"The long road. I'm a man, late thirties and I've been diagnosed with BPD for about 8 years now. It's been a long journey with varying therapies. I'm learning more and more that emotional neglect and abuse has caused. I function quite well, considering depression and anxiety are frequent life partners. 

I'm doing the reading on CEN (Childhood Emotional Neglect) and it has been a real eye-opener. Equally, I have been reading Brene Brown's work and it touched many nerves.

I feel a constant failure and an alien in the world, That I'm faulty beyond repair. I understand so much of why but it's tough to manage and change where possible. 

Like many in my situation what lies behind me are so many messed up relationships. Friends, partners and even family. I have no confidence and ability to manage in that world. I understand that I often will do everything for everyone else as I don't count myself as worthy or deserving of their care.

The truth is I'm just terrified. I have a phobia of intimacy on all levels.. This isn't what I want but it feels that it is what it's going to be.

I'm trying to find a way to accept love and care. To stop doing everything by myself and not feel like a failure if I need help.

It's a long road but it's worth walking. 

I just thought I'd share my thoughts..

"Exhausted and ashamed I’ve been keeping my diagnosis a secret from friends and family for a couple of months now and I just constantly feel tired and ashamed. Keeping the facade up of being “normal” and fine takes so much out of me, and I’m constantly feeling ashamed of my diagnosis and feeling like I’m lying to everyone. I’ve kept my depression a secret for most of my life just because my family has always viewed mental illnesses as some sort of fatal flaw and bashed people for being weak and not just “dealing with it” when it comes to mental health. I hate the stigma around mental health or the idea that just because I’m not as “in control” of my emotions as someone else means I’m unstable. But most of all, I hate that I buy into all that crap everyone’s telling me and feeling like things will never get better so I’ll just have to keep pretending forever. 

I stopped seeing my therapist because I’ve moved to a different country but haven’t sought out another therapist because I think a part of me just doesn’t want to be better. I’m so disgusted at myself for intentionally not seeking help so I can feel sad and anxious for as long as possible - anything to keep me from feeling empty again.

 Now I just had an appointment with a physiotherapist and he seemed like he really wanted to open my eyes or something. I was crying while he was nonstop talking, I feel like a child right now. He was telling me the most basic stuff like 'let the past be the past, life is good' and was constantly asking me if I had friends, why I don't keep a job, what kind of anxieties do I have,wether I don't have any life goals. As if i did not try... As if I could turn a switch on and suddenly be an energetic, optimistic, structured and completely different person. I was so perplexed because I was not expecting this, I kept saying things I did not want to say and didn't come up with better things to say until I already left. He was telling me he was also growing up in a childrens home and it doesn't matter, some people have way worse experiences. Sure he is right to some degree, overthinking everything is bad, but is it really just a matter of willingness? Of course not... Isn't it? This conversation is the exact reason I'm hiding myself at home. I'm going to get in a mental hospital soon which is why I dont currently work. He said it's no use and I should have worked harder to not overthink, seeing a psychologist is bad because you should live in presence and not talk about the past over and over. I should rather do sports and I cant blame my psyche for my pain, everyone has mental pressure. Yes, there are so many things I want to do...
In the end he talked about my lip piercing 'why do beautiful girls have to spoil their looks with those things, if you were my daughter I would not allow that' as if I was fucking twelve.

Sorry for this rant, he was really hitting some nerves. Yes, I don't function like most other people and I lost my spirit. Does this mean I cant get handled with respect? Do I have to earn it by having a university degree and work full time? Cant we just accept that everyone has made different life experiences and let everyone go at their own pace?

"Obsession and Accused Manipulation Long story short, met a girl, fell for her when I met her, we kissed, she didn’t want anything further, we remained close friends for over a year and I still had feelings, always holding out hope that something would happen.

Also everyone accuses me of being manipulative and trying to ruin other people’s lives because I’m unhappy with my own which is completely untrue which caused me to end up hospitalised last night after self harming","[[{'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.6515340209007263}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.5049754977226257}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.06744514405727386}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.04016364738345146}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.035165879875421524}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.026154208928346634}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.021001150831580162}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.015571646392345428}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.014428642578423023}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.01439200434833765}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.013481155037879944}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.011986009776592255}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.009082981385290623}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.007830286398530006}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.007317865267395973}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.006152767688035965}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.005854838062077761}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.004286457318812609}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.0038409088738262653}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.0031813071109354496}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.002997123170644045}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0027546053752303123}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.0027076529804617167}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.0017873274628072977}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.0017035015625879169}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.0009475626284256577}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.0008951685740612447}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.0008505676523782313}]]"

"Anyone else here get ""triggered"" when your SO hangs out with other people? Hi there, I'm new to this community, I've been realizing I have some tendencies that may be BPD (not looking for diagnosis, don't worry!). So my SO and I have been together for 2+ years (LDR up until about a few months ago), and since about six months into our relationship, I've gotten super worked up when they hang out with friends. I'll actually go into an anxiety attack if I find out they have plans after work, I will cry and spam them with texts/calls. I just feel like I'm so alone, and that they clearly think their friends are way better than me because they would rather hang out with them and cause me extreme anxiety and hurt than not go out with them. I know there's logic in my mind somewhere, but the emotions take over and I get angry and sad and clingy all at once and it's caused so many fights. I hate that I'm like this and hate I'm already obsessing about the weekend and whether they'll be going out.

Sorry for the rant, it's just been tough and I'd like to know if any of you have similar feelings/behaviors and how you deal with them. We've tried a few different things (SO not telling me if they're out (with my permission), cutting off texting for the night before they go out). I love my SO so so much and I want to be better for myself and for them!","[[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.436384379863739}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.324605792760849}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.28787052631378174}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.2190699726343155}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.1279992163181305}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.11047262698411942}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.10946989804506302}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.09713856130838394}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.06556455045938492}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.06316372752189636}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.05433543026447296}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.048845063894987106}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.029573744162917137}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.024543995037674904}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.020888766273856163}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.016361478716135025}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.015766844153404236}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.015528224408626556}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.015290551818907261}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.013449376448988914}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.012988210655748844}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.011673584580421448}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.011028752662241459}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.0052756802178919315}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.004882513545453548}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.0025781095027923584}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.0017891719471663237}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.0011476021027192473}]]"
"Handling Abandonment Threats...? Hey guys. This is my first post. I have been working on managing my BPD very closely for the past year, and I have made a lot of progress with DBT and other areas of life-managing that I also pursue. I am comorbid with bipolar disorder for which I take lithium and seroquel. I am a recovering alcoholic with two years of sobriety, and work very hard at the program of Alcoholics Anonymous, attending meetings and working with a sponsor and doing the steps. I am also very invested in the Christian faith, which also gives me an added degree of stability. Living in my skin is not exactly easy, but I work hard to be able to actually say that for the first time in my life, I am stable. I am about to finish my second master's degree in teaching, I have custody of my two young children, my own apartment. The presentation of BPD symptoms in my life is actually very rare.

But there is just one problem that I am facing, and for me, it is a big one. My partner of two and a half years has this terrible, terrible habit of threatening to leave me when we argue. He will threaten it, and then cut off contact with me for a period of time.

This never fails to absolutely throw me into what I can only describe as a living hell. I go from being a stable person who has a manageable life to feeling like I am falling apart in pieces. It is like there is this demon inside me that I have learned how to keep trapped in a cage but whenever he threatens and then acts out intent to leave me, it's like this demon gets out and jumps on me and starts clawing me to pieces. I am suddenly battling these impulses to drink, to cut myself, sometimes even to kill myself. It just explodes out of nowhere and I come unglued. I scream and yell and sob and beg him to stop. And like this most recent time, I flat out told him that if he breaks up with me then I will find someone else. 

All this feels so foolish as I am writing it. I realize that my partner didn't cause my BPD. He is not responsible for my management of it. He does not make me do or not do anything that I don't choose. But this abandonment thing is like a weird achilles heel. I am happy, functional, stable, going about living my daily life....but as soon as he threatens and acts like he is going to leave me in response to an argument, it's like suddenly none of the hard work I've done in the past year, past several years, matters. I feel like my emotions get so out of control it feels like I am fighting for my life. 

Again.... I am my own singular, separate person who is responsible for herself. I understand this. But I have asked him in the past, no matter how upset he becomes at me, to please just not threaten to nuke our relationship....because this is what it does to me inside and it is just horrible. Yet...if we argue to a heated enough point, he always drops this bomb. A day later he will take it back. I forgive. I try to push away the haunting remnants of how this one element of my existence is enough to make me feel like I am completely coming undone. I try to hope he will never again do this to me in a fight. 

Recently, as I was saying, we argued and he began to threaten and act like he was leaving me and I fell to pieces. As I was sobbing and screaming and begging him on the phone not to, I told him that if he broke up with me, I would find someone else. This was the worst thing I said. 

It has been three days since, and I have as I tend to do just let it go and hope that he won't ever threaten abandonment again in an argument. He, however, is very wound up still about the fact that I told him I would date other people if he left me. He hasn't let that go, claims that he is devastated that I would say that. 

I finally just wrote him a letter and reminded him of what happens inside of me every time that we fight and he threatens and acts like he is abandoning me, that it is like hell on earth, and how could he still be holding on to me saying I would find someone else if he did indeed leave me? 

I'm really screwed up right now, I've let my phone die and I'm afraid to turn it on because I am sure that he is again going to get angry at me and start threatening to leave me again. I'm just so tired of my emotions telling me that I am going to lose my whole life and I am going to destroy myself if this man leaves me. As I write it, I feel really foolish and insane for even admitting that I have this experience. I just want to kill this demon that tells me to self-destruct and makes me feel like I am going to self-destruct every time my partner does this to me.

"My ex gf has BPD - Worrying about someone you lost Lurked for a while, first time posting. I recently broke up with my almost 6 year gf, and it ended up awfully. Even though I cannot, and will not, contact her, I still worry every day for her mental health. My friends are taking care of her to an extent, but I just know and feel her.

She is dating someone else, which is great and I'm very excited about. Nonetheless, she can get obsessed pretty quickly. And I know more about the guy than she ever will, with a history of abuse, even hitting a partner before, and borderline abusing sexually another partner (she had to make him stop forcefully). I know that she probably think the world is stable for the first time in weeks, craving love and attention, but we &lt;all&gt; know how tragic that's gonna end up.

Knowing stuff like that just worries me, not as an ex, but because I wanted her to get better, and I know that guy will destroy her. What's the best way to deal with a person with BPD (her, in this case), who will never have your direct support again? Should I talk to our friends, even though they will not do anything/think I'm trying to ruin her possibilities of happiness? My current s/o, who's been very supportive, knows about the story and is worried sick about it as well.

"Seeing things, mental breakdowns, voices My girlfriend has been diagnosed with BPD after an attempted suicide a few years back. She has been through a very tough time in the last year and it is taking a toll on her. Lately she is starting to show signs of paranoia or schizophrenia. After doing research it appears that BPD could almost be a diagnosis that falls under something more major such as schizophrenia. She has been having fits of anger or depression and lashing out during these times. All the usual things you would expect from someone with BPD, either ""I don't deserve you"" or ""Fuck you I hate you"". I understand these and try to react accordingly. But lately she has been having terrible episodes and has gotten the idea in her head that she is being followed by a demon. She is seeing shadows and figures, and hearing voices telling her things. It is extremely terrifying to her and as much as i try to reassure her it is okay it doesn't work. The odd part is after her episodes she tends to forget anything that happened as she lashed out. She will be at the verge of breaking up with me and then be totally fine and forget things that she has done or said. I am looking for some insight on this, more so on the paranoia side and the forgetfulness she appears to be having after episodes. I'm starting to believe she was either misdiagnosed or she has developed into something more severe after the trauma she has faced over the last year.","[[{'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.30114397406578064}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.2999727725982666}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.14120475947856903}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.12944595515727997}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.04785040766000748}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.04542859271168709}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.04521981254220009}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.03650825470685959}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.026514040306210518}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.01881539262831211}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.015284120105206966}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.010487442836165428}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.009148016571998596}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.008265865035355091}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.005708510521799326}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.00497210118919611}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.0046813515946269035}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.00463517103344202}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.003541079582646489}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.0031281523406505585}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.002967463806271553}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.002529565943405032}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.002347302623093128}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0021151909604668617}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.0019332680385559797}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.0014202020829543471}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.0010351726086810231}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.00029554235516116023}]]"
"DAE purposely force yourself to stay upset/distressed/angry/etc? I got SUPER upset today when my friend told me she dropped the only class we had together, and even cried in the middle of the day. I even considered ditching the rest of my classes (which I've *never* done before).

"How do you forgive yourself when you've done something horrible that you never thought you would ever do? Since this is anonymous, I'm just gonna come out and say it. And I want to apologize in advance if this hurts anyone's feelings, because I did one of the biggest ""no-nos"" someone like me should never do. 

I'm not gonna describe the whole situation for the sake of keeping this concise, but I had a 4 hour rage episode this past Monday. I said a lot of shitty things to my boyfriend and best friend. 

Well, my best friend essentially told me that our mutual friend R had stolen money from me. I was angry because I don't have enough money to live as it is, and even the measly $10 that was stolen from me cut me deep and made me enraged. 

So.... *sigh*, here's some context. I'm white. My boyfriend, L, is black. My best friend T is white and R, who is black, is one of T's good friends (in spite of the sketchy behavior R does from time to time). 

I got so angry that I called R the N word in front of T and L. 

I'll spare you the rest of the story, but the magnitude of what I said absolutely cuts me to my core. I feel the kind of guilt you would feel killing someone in cold blood. 

I'm not looking for sympathy. Please don't pity me. I'm just trying to figure out how to reconcile the fact that I got so uncontrollably BPD angry that I let such a foul and malevolent racial slur come out of my mouth, ESPECIALLY since I'm white. 

I've told jokes with racial slurs from time to time, just not with the N word. I particularly like making jokes about my own race. Redneck, cracker, filthy pourtugee (I have some Portuguese in me, but I appear white), all funny to me. Some people think racist jokes just shouldn't be made by anyone, and while I disagree, I see where one may come to that understanding. 

But this wasn't a joke. Some stupid white people might say ""nigga"" as a joke even though it's inappropriate to do so, but what I said is different. I used the hard R, and there was anger (and dare I say hatred) in my voice as I said it. If I'm honest about why I chose the word, it was because I wanted to find the meanest word possible cuz I was so angry. I don't hate black people. But I crossed a line that my BF and best friend soon won't forget. They've forgiven me, they know about my BPD. But I can't forgive this. I just can't.

"DAE struggle with thoughts of promiscuity? I’m sure a lot of you know that a major symptom of BPD is promiscuity. I struggled with that a lot. My whole first year at university, I slept with about 30 people. I probably only spent 1 night each week sleeping alone in my own bed because I was just so terrified of being alone and I was so desperate to have someone want me and love me. 

It worked fine at the time. I didn’t care about me and it was fine. Most of the guys I slept with didn’t care about me and it was fine. I’d go home with someone and it was fine. I’d leave the next day in last night’s clothes and smeared make up, but it was fine. It was easy to forget about the names and the faces and the sex because I was either super numb or super drunk. It didn’t matter to me. I didn’t care about these people. It was like “hey you stopped me from self harming or worse so thanks have a nice life” and that was that. 

And then I met my SO. He’s the definition of amazing. We met when I was 19 while I was still in the promiscuous phase. But I met him and it was like everything else was ancient history. I never even thought about sleeping with another guy. I didn’t want anybody else. I wanted him and only him. It’s been 2 and a half years and we’re still going strong and I’ve never once even been tempted to get with another guy. 

But I’ve recently come out of a mental health ward. I tried to kill myself by overdosing on my medication and so my doctors completely cut me off, which, in their defence, was probably a good idea. 

But since I’ve been off my meds, I’ve really been struggling with the memories of the people I’ve previously slept with. The memories all kinda blur together but I feel like pure shit when I think of how I was back then. I feel so vulnerable and contaminated when I think about it, and the anxiety of it makes me wanna slice myself open or rip all my skin off. 

Have any of you experienced the same?

"He’s perfect, so why am I so unhappy? I’ve been with my boyfriend for a year and a half. We have lived together for a while now and he’s everything I’ve ever wanted in a man - He’s caring, extremely supportive, copes with my BPD, and encourages me to do things my anxiety causes me to back out of (eg: job opportunities, following my dreams etc)

He’s basically the supportive, loving, funny, handsome man that all women dream of having to themselves, but for some reason, I just feel deflated and unhappy. I don’t know why, and I don’t know if it’s just a phase. 

We spend quality time together, he always puts me first, and he knows exactly how to make me laugh when I’m feeling down. My sex drive is shot, I have had absolutely no sex drive for the past 8 months or so. Until that point, I would have considered myself to have a high sex drive, always up for it, always going for it, but now I don’t initiate, sex is like a chore to me. If my boyfriend initiates, I kinda feel uncomfortable and don’t want to. 

I chalked this up to my use of Sertraline 100mg for over a year, but I’ve been off them cold turkey for about 4 months now and I’ve seen next to no improvement (My ability to orgasm and sexual stimulation are back, but the drive? Nope) My boyfriend asked me a question “Maybe your lack of sex drive is because you no longer find me sexually attractive?”  I don’t think that’s the case - He’s very attractive in my eyes, I think he’s hot and he is great in bed, so I doubt that is the issue. 

I don’t know what’s wrong. Aside from my own self-inflicted anxiety about his ex, his feelings for me and all other BPD-caused anxieties, I generally *should* be happy, so why do I feel so low? And why do I feel as though it’s related to my relationship?","[[{'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.3995767831802368}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.2651006877422333}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.15665102005004883}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.10716751217842102}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.0873134434223175}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.07585814595222473}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.057953283190727234}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.05120420083403587}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.039585452526807785}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.0287486519664526}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.027506809681653976}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.025219039991497993}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.02276974357664585}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.015246245078742504}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.013113591820001602}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.00897213164716959}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.007281070109456778}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.00611716927960515}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.006016645114868879}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.0058100358583033085}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.005498531274497509}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.005334264598786831}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.004957994911819696}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.0029725837521255016}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.002355717122554779}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.002047506161034107}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.0020264515187591314}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.0014495771611109376}]]"
"Psychiatrist doesn’t believe in labels? I was diagnosed with Major Depressive and General Anxiety disorders from a prior psychiatrist and I’m on 300mg Wellbutrin XL and (off-label) 300 mg Neurontin twice a day. I’ve gotten a new psychiatrist and we are keeping the same medications. I have seen him twice now, and the first time we talked for about an hour and I explained my symptoms and prior diagnoses. He gave me a pamphlet describing BPD, and didn’t really say much besides “This has been happening a long time. Read these and tell me if you can relate to these symptoms.” I read them and did relate, and this last time I went to see him I told him that and he told me okay, I don’t have to be labeled with BPD. He didn’t give me a diagnosis, and I’m unsure of me being BPD or not. It’s not the matter of having an official diagnosis so I can label myself, I want to have concrete proof so I can get more information of my condition so that I can take care of myself. I don’t want to assume or have a wrong label and I could have been working or trying different treatments instead.","[[{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5293863415718079}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.21204307675361633}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.16136175394058228}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.06353284418582916}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.034808434545993805}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.02575412206351757}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.025599917396903038}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.019075915217399597}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.014110170304775238}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.012327510863542557}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.011457854881882668}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.006574671249836683}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.005574588663876057}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.004359775222837925}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.004039730876684189}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.0023255376145243645}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.0020710357930511236}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0015993484994396567}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.0014116524253040552}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.0012802844867110252}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.001250352244824171}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.0011427014833316207}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.0010958465281873941}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.0010156884090974927}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.000937582110054791}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.0006004631286486983}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.0004527232958935201}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.00035552604822441936}]]"
"My FP hasnt been a part of my life since 2011. This whole thing bullshit as fuck.

"Partner has BPD and I'm exhausted A few months ago my partner of three years was diagnosed with BPD. As is common in situations of the type that I'm in, the entire relationship has been a roller coaster from the start, and one which nearly derailed entirely before her diagnosis when the news came out that she had been unfaithful with me on multiple occasions (and with multiple people). I forgave her, and we started afresh in another city. 

A month into our new life, there have been a few improvements, but our relationship is much the same as it was before, minus the physical violence. She is still incredibly fearful of abandonment, yet acts in such a volatile and maddening way that it makes me leave/hang up the phone mid row almost every time that we do. She is unrelentingly critical and unforgiving of my behaviour, whilst taking almost twice as long to admit fault in her own. 

Obviously, when things are great, they really are, otherwise I wouldn't be doing this, but I'm nearly at my wits end dealing the constantly elevated stress levels - and being a fairly dismissive/avoiding type myself I feel as though I'm taking double the brunt, although I understand that it may be contributing to my problems a good deal.

Can anyone offer any advice?

"Do you have outbursts of anger? Would you say you are more of an extrovert or introvert? I am asking this because I know many people with bpd struggle with outbursts of anger, screaming and just letting it all out.

Well, I don't. I get really angry and upset, too, but for me it just goes inwards. As in, I shut down completely and can't say anything because there's so much chaos in my head, I can't think straight and it makes me go silent.

I think I did have outbursts in the past with my parents (the question is, how much of that was the bpd and how much was normal puberty) and I started controlling what I said more, choosing my words before saying something.

But how it is now is not much better because I can't communicate at all. I think part of the problem is that I am so unsure about which feelings and reactions are justified and which are just an overreaction that I don't know how to handle it.

Anyway, I can't help but wonder if there are other people like me who turn their anger inwards and shut down and if there is any correlation between this and extroversion/introversion...","[[{'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.4137741029262543}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.30866923928260803}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.26640525460243225}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.16722479462623596}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.1213199645280838}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.0943116620182991}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.08251716941595078}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.060277678072452545}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.042675066739320755}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.022499876096844673}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.021301254630088806}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.017954720184206963}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.01645789109170437}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.01013537123799324}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.009353132918477058}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.007531887385994196}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.005272768437862396}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.003598978044465184}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.003519139951094985}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.0030931115616112947}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.003088387893512845}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.0029262336902320385}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.0018882332369685173}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.001714488840661943}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.0017123071011155844}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.00111679220572114}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.0005822323146276176}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.00047734827967360616}]]"
"How do you hold down a job? I was diagnosed yesterday and I'm so relieved that how I am is actually a thing and I'm not just a weird anomaly who no one will ever understand. 

I haven't had a steady job in almost 10 years... I've had a few jobs but nothing more than a few months and then it all gets too much and I can't take it and I just don't go back. So I can't get references and I don't want to apply for jobs because who's going to hire me if I'm honest and say I've walked out of every job I've ever had? And even if I blag my way into a position I feel like they'll figure out I'm a big faker and I'll end up letting people down and walking out again so what's the point?

I tried to start my own business but I don't promote it because all I can see are the flaws and I feel like I'm taking advantage of people if I sell any of my work to them.

I wanna be productive, to contribute, to create ANY kind of stability for myself but it just seems impossible.

This is his first real relationship, virgin and all considering I was his first kiss. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety at 12 but with BPD at 15.

"I’m single and happy I didn’t think it was possible but I am literally as happy as I have been in a long time and I think I know why. I struggle with codependency often as many may be able to relate to. If someone I care about is struggling, especially someone I am in a relationship with, it is not going to be long until I find myself in the same position that I just climbed out of. This discovery has made me think a couple of things. First, that means I do have something to work on in therapy. I have been at a stand still in therapy because overall I am doing very well and coping better than I have in my 24 years of life. This is huge because this is important, I know for a fact there is a way to be empathetic without taking on the situation as if it was my own. Second, I think I have been holding to much onto the past. I without a doubt have dealt with mental health problems, but I think I have been stopping myself from getting better, if that makes sense. I had it in my head that if I wasn’t sick/ as sick as I was that people would leave because without my mental illnesses I am plain as can be. I can’t allow myself to let this happen anymore because of the simple fact that on my good days I feel amazing. I have no right to take away from my happiness. Lastly, I don’t need let people invalidate me. I know where I have been, where I am going, how I felt, and how I feel now. I don’t need anyone to validate me, I can do that on my own. The only thing I have to do is not let people take away parts of who I am. I am a pretty cool person, just like all of you. We all deserve to feel like we are being heard.

"Need advice on a confusing situation Hey all, i'll try to keep it brief. 
Been in a relationship for 4 years now. We met freshman year in college. Love-bombed him hard in the beginning, but he had never had a gf or even been kissed for that matter, so he obliged me, and fell for me. Around the 2 year mark I got bored and started cheating. was able to justify it to myself because he was a video game addict, dismissive, etc etc. Anyways he quickly caught on that I was cheating, but I continued to deny. Hurt him really bad as you can imagine. I moved out with the help of my friend and was happy to make a clean break. The month I was out of his house was the official breakup. After the one month mark we started hanging out as friends. That's when I fell back into it, and realized the consequences of my actions. Long story short: I moved back in quickly and rather assertively. He was hesitant to let me back in but since he really loved me he agreed. Well it's been a year since I moved back in and the guilt of everything is eating me alive. I can't even move most days because his words during the breakup keep coming back to me. I feel like I wasted years of his life. And he can never be happy around me because I am mentally ill. He's really trying to be optimistic and is just all around awesome, but I feel like subconsciously he doesn't feel loved and deserves someone who wouldn't just latch on.

"Is it an episode or am I really just a jerk? I’ve never really posted on here before besides the occasionally comment here or there... but I am concerned that I am slowly screwing up my relationship. I feel as if the whole BPD part of me is getting worse, and I can’t stop the extreme anger and I lash out and say the worst things to people whom had done nothing to me. It’s like I get mad just looking at people, and some days I hate my girlfriend and want to be alone, but then again I don’t ever want to be alone and I know I’ll be nothing without her. Also does anyone else start to lack empathy and are unable to detect what others are feeling in an episode? It drives me nuts but I needed a vent before I go back out there.

"Wish people understood. I feel so misunderstood when it comes to my illness. I'm 20 and have the disorder the past couple of years, but my mood swings are starting to get really bad lately. My friends and family do not understand what it means to suffer from this. A lot of the time I feel so alone with my thoughts that I just want to end it all. I try to control my moods with medication and therapy, but they still cause me a lot of pain. The only reason I am posting this is because I wish people would tell me I am not alone.

"I’m in a dilemma First off, I have been diagnosed with BPD a couple of years ago and have worked tremendously to resolve a lot of problems that come with it.

The problem isn’t about me though. It’s my partner. He’s been diagnosed with bipolar disorder for a while, but he exhibits “rapid cycling,” meaning certain moments of stress result in him reaching a period of psychosis. He blacks out during this time. He’s inconsolable. He will bang his fists on walls and scream. You can try to calm him down and NOTHING helps. 

Anyway, he’s been living at my apartment this last year (not supposed to be...he’s not on the lease) and there have been probably four incidents or more that the police had to be called because he was in an episode. He’s not violent towards anyone, more himself. The worst was when he got upset and I caught him trying to hang himself off the stairs banister. I saved him and immediately called the police. He was sent to a mental hospital for about five days. Surprisingly, with all the noise he causes, my neighbors haven’t reported it to the front office...until now.

Last Sunday, he went into a full blown episode at my apartment because of something to do with work. Police were called, they had to sedate him with ketamine, take him to the hospital for a day. The front office called and said multiple neighbors called and asked what happened. I told them my “friend” came over, became unstable, and the police had to come. She told me that I needed to tell him that he’s banned from the property. After he got out of the hospital, his doctor put him on Seroquel and he promised that nothing would happen again. I warned him that I didn’t need attention on my place. 

Three days later, he was sent home from work early. I’m guessing he did something that they didn’t like. I wasn’t home when he got home, but when I opened the door, I heard him moaning REALLY loud in my bathroom upstairs. I ran up and he had his belt tightening around his neck. I called 911 as I pulled the belt. They came and I called his parents who showed up as well. I had ten cops in my place...ten cop cars outside flashing their lights...and this was all at 3am. They didn’t sedate him inside..instead pulled him out and he was screaming bloody murder. I saw so many bedroom lights turning on...and this was a Thursday morning. People were so pissed, i’m sure.

Well, he’s in a mental hospital..almost been a week. The property manager said if he sets foot on property again, i’ll be evicted. I got my locks changed. He’s going to have to stay at his parents’ house from now on. I packed up his stuff to move them to his parents. The problem is...he understands that living with me is no option now.  But, I’ve been on the phone with me and he’s already acting controlling. He said, “well, if I can’t be at your place, you shouldn’t have anyone over.” I said, “calm down, I should be allowed to have anyone I want. My friends aren’t banned from here.” He started getting angry and hung up. I’m just worried things are going to escalate and he’s going to become obsessive, paranoid (that I’m cheating), and needy because he can’t come. Also, there’s the risk that he shows up uninvited and makes a scene at my door without me answering. I know I could call the cops, but it just seems like potential to turn into a really scary relationship. Any advice?

"Is anybody else a ‘bad driver’?  Hi,  I am a 17 year old female. My friends often criticize my driving even though I have never ever had an accident that was my fault (a guy backed into me in a subway parking lot once, left a huge dent in my door) and i have never been pulled over and I have a completely clean driving record. They always complain that I am ‘jolty’ and that I’m a bad driver. It makes me feel really bad about myself but I can’t help but wonder, if I was really that terrible of a driver would I have passed my road test? I have been driving for 5 months, as in my province you cannot receive your license until you’re 17.
 The thing I feel that I should mention, is that everybody who complains about my driving, they themselves can’t drive, or they have multiple penalties on their license, have rear ended people, been pulled over multiple times, etc. Why do they think they have room to talk? Also, just in case I really am a ‘bad’ driver, how do I become better?
 I do know that ‘risky driving’ is often considered to be an aspect of BPD but I’m not sure I’d consider my driving risky. I’m very anxious about being pulled over because I’m not sure how I’d react so I always abide by the rules of the road I’m on. I don’t speed or bring illegal things into my vehicle. I just don’t understand what’s so terrible about my driving and the more my friends complain about it, the more I either want to stop letting people into my car, or to just give up driving all together. 
 Does anybody have any advice? Please help :(

"New BPD diagnosis I was diagnosed with GAD when i was 15. I was diagnosed Bipolar I when I was 20 years old. And my doctor just added another one on top of that at 23. She says I exhibit a lot of cluster b traits and that she believes I have BPD (and a major codependent problem) as well, which makes sense. I can see that. She’s thinking that I may also have schizotypal personally disorder. I just feel like that’s so much and it makes me feel like it may be too much to handle. No meds are working significantly, therapy hasn’t been helping. I’m just not sure how to take this all in. 

I keep freaking out thinking, is this really worth it, if I have all of this wrong with me and nothing is helping? And are they even right? Am I just hard to deal with and they’re throwing every possibly diagnosis at me since they can’t figure out why I am this way?

"Narcissistic parents and BPD I've been reading a lot lately on how narcissistic parent's behavior can cause their child to develop BPD and anxiety.

I was wondering if anyone else here diagnosed with BPD can relate.

"I can't endure this anymore Minimal context:

19 years old
Male
Narcissistic home

I hate myself for being so stupid, I am quite intelligent as to have great grades; however, my way of behaving, my conducts, my mental process is (according to myself, and believe me, I know myself) stupid.

I've come to accept the fact that I am not this great mastermind, I got the highest scholarship on my college, but at the same time I cannot remember most of the drive routes I go by.

Anxiety and BPD have not been helping either.

And this semester has been hell for me, I want to learn, I really do, but anytime I ask a question or I make a mistake I end up receiving nuclear backlash from my teachers.

When I asked a question that was actually about my answering method (which was correct), I was told that I was mediocre, that I did not have even the basics to comprehend the course and that this was going to be the end of me.

Today at class a professor told me to get out and that I was going to fail his class. We are 3 weeks in the course and I've already made this much enemies.

I ask questions, do my homework, study a lot until the point of burnout. However I am not able to perform as expected.

Every semester I am afraid to lose my scholarship and now I am scared that I might be losing it because of some asshole.

How do you endure these experiences? I have no more motivation, I end up being made a fool of most people, I hate myself.","[[{'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.3167654573917389}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.27308928966522217}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.1583757996559143}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.08895288407802582}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.07076209783554077}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.06638901680707932}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.05141594260931015}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.02378552407026291}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.022097691893577576}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.021906202659010887}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.019824787974357605}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.014546368271112442}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.012768187560141087}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.007598235737532377}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.006734334863722324}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.0064004333689808846}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.005524940323084593}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.004115286283195019}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.003434563521295786}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.0033910414204001427}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.003366828663274646}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.0030625169165432453}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.0024933621753007174}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.002265440532937646}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.0018829607870429754}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.0014559548581019044}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.0011323493672534823}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.000758761540055275}]]"

"Growing up and my abandonment issues. This is going to be a lot, basically starting from the beginning until now because I never really felt comfortable talking about it but I want to feel better. 


Growing up, I always thought I had a relatively normal childhood. I don't think I realized how abnormal my childhood was and the way I was treated until I started learning about mental illnesses existing. My dad left me and my mom on christmas morning when I was 4 years old to be with his new girlfriend, (who he cheated on my mom with) and her kids. I don't specifically remember this but I do know that it had a lot to do with how I feel today about relationships and people. I was four years old, christmas was supposed to be a great day for me but it was the day my dad chose a different family over me. HE was the one who wanted me to begin with and then he just left. 
So my parents split and I had to spend weekends with my dad and his new girlfriend, they treated me like I was absolute fucking garbage. His girlfriend hated me because I was a byproduct of my dad and my moms relationship, she hated that I was PROOF of it, that I looked like my mom, and that I was the reason my dad still had to associate with my mom. From age 4+ she treated me and TOLD me that I was stupid, too fat, too ugly, etc. 

My dad was too blind to really see how she treated me and he ignored it. I had really bad anxiety (I didn't realize at the time.) and I'd have full blown panic attacks on the ground and they would just yell at me and treat me like garbage, like the way I was acting was just weird and they'd call me psychotic. I wasn't even in the 3rd grade. It took them watching me take care of my dying mom and her dying when I was in middle school for them to at least try to be nice to me. 

Now that I'm an adult and I have an understanding of mental illness and my own brain, I realize how much all of this has affected me and I've basically been living in denial most of my life. I thought most of the way I acted was ""normal"" and that I was just over-sensitive and things affected me more, which I mean is true but it was more than just that. I don't even know where I was going with all of this anymore but I just needed to get some things off my chest, I guess.

"Anyone diagnosed with BPD in the Seddit community? I've followed and learned a lot from the /r/seduction community over the last few years, but have always felt like I have internal drives which really detract from my success in life, and specifically long-term relationships with women.

Women have always been a primary motivator in my life, for better or worse. I can feel like superman when I'm in a healthy relationship, or like the absolute scum of the earth when I'm feeling perceived abandonment. I could go more into that but its not really the point of this post.

Recently, a mental-health professional I know personally told me that as long as she's known me, she's noticed that I exhibit Cluster B traits at times, and thinks that I should look into starting treatment for BPD. I haven't been diagnosed yet, but the more I read about it, the more sense it makes.

Anyhow, I was wondering today if any of you with BPD who follow Seddit have learned to overcome it successfully and what your stories of being successful in self-improvement and dating have been?

"Borderline without provocations? Hello everyone a while ago I met this amazing and beautiful girl, I saw her twice in real life, then she went away and we kept in touch over the phone. A little while ago, she told me she had borderline and I'm starting to read up on the disease. Everywhere I read that people with borderline provoke other people to hide their pain (if I got it right), but she has never gotten angry with me (as far as I know) or called me names, etc. She sometimes doesn't respond to me for a while, after we've quite intimate talks, but I don't get the feeling she's trying to provoke me. I mostly get the idea that she's just very said and feels a lot to pain when things get intimate. Can anyone give some directions on if she's feeling betrayed or not?

So I saw my psychiatrist today and she brought dbt for like the 10th time. 

I am apprehensive because it's expensive if I do it through private health.

I don't get it's purpose is it like coping techniques? 

I would mainly like to not have constant si and less avoidant.

Can any one explain it?

"BPD - BPD co-dependent relationship Hello, my name is John. I am a BPD diagnosed male, 29 years old. In the past 10 years I've been living the quiet life of dead inside and just being a workhorse and occasionally pouring some drugs and prostitutes over the wounds to keep me going.

I've met a very understanding girl that's also BPD and which managed to wake up all the repressed emotions like needing closeness and validation. We understand that the only thing which can result from this is a co-dependent relationship but I can't seem to find information on the internet on how we can use this to heal because until now it has helped eachother immensely and I'm already almost double the longest I've ever been in a relationship with someone. We're dedicated to being to eachother what others haven't been to us. And we have compatible fetishes and sex drives. Been through a few splitting episodes, we turned out fine, the other always understood what was happening and knew what to do to de-escalate. There is potential to make this work or am I just finding justifications?

"Abandonment fears. So tonight I went to my BPD peer-support group and I was already in a weird head space after stressful energy between me and the wife. I did not want to go, but we went.

It was as busy as I expected, given the super blue moon tonight and it had me on edge. I ended up sitting in ""my spot"", but there was a dude sitting next to me and it just added to my stress because I couldn't put enough space between the two of our chairs. I always sit in my spot.

Anyways, check in starts and it's fine and all, I'm prepared to talk about my frustration with the psychiatrist I waited 3 months to see and what a waste of time it was. But we get to this one person in particular that brings up their child, and how they moved here 10 years ago to have a relationship and be close to this child, but now that the child is a teenager and it's been ten years and there's a relationship, they feel like it's time to leave and move on with their life.

This hit me so fucking hard and ruined my entire night because I'm dealing with abandonment issues with the two father figures in my life that don't even really care about me (it feels like, anyway). My biological father who spent more time fighting to habe a relationship with his son that he wasn't allowed to see, instead of caring about the daughter who was eager to have him a part of hers. And my step-dad who now barely speaks to me since he married someone new and I moved out of their house.

I feel grief from this everyday and to hear someone even considering that choice of leaving because the child is a teenager now and they want to get on with their own life... I ended up leaving before open discussion. It's now 4 hours later and I'm still in this headspace of anger and sadness. Tried calling my step dad.

"I helped someone today Someone in my mother's group was talking about their crazy MIL. They slapped her with a BPD diagnosis (which sounds correct with what she was saying) and called her crazy. Everyone else joined in saying her MIL's text of crying for help (sounded very suicidal) was just manipulative and to ignore her. I'm the only one with BPD in that group and it hurt to see how everyone was calling people with BPD horrible. 
So I went in there and nicely told them how bpd  feels and yes, there are shitty people, but not to just demonize anyone with BPD. She had a great conversation with me, asked for some advice, and thanked me for actually shedding some light on the ways of bpd thinking. I even gave her some tips to create healthy boundaries. 
It made me feel good to help in a way. Just the little things here and there, I guess.

Impulse no.2 : I really want an animal so i'm obsessing about it even If I know I could be kick out of my dorm if I bring an animal. I'm thinking about rat and rn i'm fantasizing about how nice it will be to have them. 
Impulse no.3 : thinking about suicide and/or self-harm, I probably have enough pill. 
Impulse no.4 : thinking about drop out of school and build a mini-house just because I don't want to deal with math classes. 
Impulse no.5 : taking a membership to a gym even though I know I don't have the motivation( I actually did this one)

"Has anyone stopped having sex? So... I have BPD and I especially get attached to someone if we have sex. If it doesn't work out then I go into a deep depression and basically cannot cope (at least, this is how it's been for me in the past). 

Since about a year and a half ago, I decided to stop having sex with men. My mood greatly improved. I no longer have volatile emotions and feel incredibly confident. 

I recently started dating someone, and I really like him and I am really attracted to him. In any other scenario, I'd want to have sex with him (and he clearly wants to have sex with me). However, I'm really afraid that if we have sex I'm going to break down again. I don't want to hate myself again and have doubts about myself or wonder why this guy isn't texting me back or whatever else. I don't know if I'm over reacting, because this guy has been really respectful to me so far, and hasn't pushed me to do anything. However, even so, I feel afraid of having sex. 

So has anyone gone through an experience like this before? Did you decide to remain celibate?

"Approaching my Psychiatrist/Therapist I have been in seeing my psychiatrist for almost two full years now, and have been seeing my therapist for a little over a year. I have made some remarkable progress and am happy right now (YAY!). I HAVE NOT BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH BPD. In fact I don't know exactly what my diagnosis is...

However, after looking in to the symptoms, I realize that the issues I have been working through, have been eerily similar; abandonment/self worth/impulsive behavior/severe anxiety/ lack of relationships/manipulative behavior/mood swings (like i am two different people)/ and the fact that the smallest, most menial thing may set me off at any moment...

my question is, what is the best way to inquire what my diagnosis is? just say ""Hey, what is my diagnosis?"" Part of me believes that they may already have me diagnosed, but I have been making great progress with things and am in a very good place right now...

I go back Monday for a visit...and of course, now my anxiety is through the roof wanting to know if this could be the diagnosis...it's a shame because I do really feel like I am making progress, but I can feel the anxiety creeping back in as I want to know what is wrong with me...So what is the best way to approach it with my Doc's?

"It feels like a never-ending nightmare each day I will try to summarize my thoughts as briefly as I can (but lord knows I wish I could vent tons and not have people skip over it...I'm guilty at times of doing that)

I am a 25yr old woman. Since I was 19, life has been a shitshow in terms of my mental health. I had my fair share of trauma and heartbreak early on in life with my brother developing severe paranoid/violent schizohrenia when I was 6. I pulled out my hair at 6 to the point of balding and had fainting spells in elementary due to the stress at home. My brother even killed my cat in childhood....I loved that cat. He lived in a group home weekdays. 

Meanwhile, my mom was a doctor shopper and constantly self medicating with all sorts of sleeping pills in my childhood while my dad was at work ALL DAY. She sometimes forgot to pick me up from school when I was only 7 and 8...so I would wait for *HOURS* until needing to try and find my way home or get help from an adult I didn't know. She was bed ridden throughout basically my whole life. Falling asleep at the wheel sort of thing and passing out in a bowl of cereal even in my teens.
She ended up overdosing on fentanyl but I found her naked in her bathroom barely breathing when I was 22. Now she has the mind of a 3 year old and walks in circles all day.

I know I shouldn't dwell on childhood trauma, but so much of this still haunts me big time??? I seriously want to kick the bucket because ON TOP of this, I am an alcoholic and have done unspeakable things to myself and lied to others. Like, I have lead a very secret life. I want to be a good person but I also want to destroy myself.

Feeling utterly alone and kind of having bad thoughts in my head","[[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.7416484951972961}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.24890771508216858}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.09948164224624634}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.07898876070976257}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.063120037317276}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.05027894303202629}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.048872318118810654}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.030858535319566727}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.02941417135298252}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.026670709252357483}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.02295306697487831}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.021686632186174393}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.021219445392489433}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.01968354359269142}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.019473999738693237}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.015945274382829666}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.014522402547299862}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.012731390073895454}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.008958468213677406}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.008250225335359573}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.006512591615319252}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.004149002954363823}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.003644729731604457}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.002998629817739129}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.002724666381254792}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.001617412082850933}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.0010135899065062404}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.00086351198842749}]]"

"Is it possible to fix what I've done? I have utterly destroyed my relationship with the best friend I've ever had. A friendship that I not only believed but KNEW was unbreakable and invincible. But it seems I was wrong. I verbally harassed, insulted, and threatened him, said things behind his back I, slandered him publicly and all the while I believed 100 percent that I was not only justified but obligated in doing so. I didn't even perceive what I was doing was wrong until he told me he wanted to cut ties with me. As soon as he said that I flipped the other way and apologized desperately but in his mind he thought I was manipulating him. This all happened a couple months ago and I was just recently diagnosed with BPD.  I had no idea what that even was until practically last week. This is a kinda half vent or rant I suppose but I'm just wondering if there's any hope that i could somehow tell him that I wasn't manipulating him on purpose and tell him my situation and in doing so start to not fix but at least mend what I've done? He has his own mental illnesses as well so I can't help but think he'd understand at least in some part right?

"Guys, I really need help. Boyfriend of 2 and a half years broke up with me and I freaked out It all started as a misunderstanding. We have a group of friends that we go out with Thursday's, Friday's and Saturday's, and a couple weeks ago I got really drunk. This one couple that I became close to told my BF that that night I had told them I slept with someone else, but the truth is I've only been faithful to him. It was dragged out over three days but he officially broke up with me and ran away because apparently looking at me makes him not want to go through with it. I knew it was the real deal this time and spammed his phone with texts and calls. I even ran outside to try and find him. Long story short, the police are in my room with me to make sure I don't hurt myself, but at this point all I want to do is go to sleep and try to talk to him in the morning.

"Of all the 9 criteria for BPD, What’s the main symptom you show? What’s a symptom you don’t relate to (if you have one)? For me, it’s lack of a self identity. This one is very extreme.  I’m a chameleon who changes and takes the form of whoever I talk to. Hence why I keep people at a distance because I’m scared they’ll find out I don’t know what to talk about or that I have truly few (to none) stable opinions...

The sign of BPD I show least is actually unstable relationships. My relationships are very stable and long lasting with practically no arguments. However, it’s only because I let so few people in. I (nicely) push out anyone who doesn’t match my strict standards.

What about you?

"Finding a therapist? Hey guys, I’m looking to finally seek help. I haven’t been officially diagnosed with BPD, but I’m aware that I have it. I’ve done tons of research, and I have no doubt that I have this disorder. I’m in an okay place right - enough distance from my FP that I can breathe, but not well enough to not have an FP. I’m not empty, but I’m not full. I’ve been way worse. 

However, upon reflection, I realize how lucky I’ve been. Most of my past FPs are still in my life, but our relationships have adjusted. I just keep thinking of how much more rewarding those friendships could have been if I had dealt with my BPD sooner. But this isn’t about them; it’s about me. I want to heal for me.

How do you find a therapist that is a good fit? My insurance is great, and has a wide network but I’m not sure where to start. I’d like to start seeing someone soon, but I’d like for it to be the right person who can help me heal, grow, and put this behind me. For those of you who got help, where did you start? And was it helpful? Do you feel better?","[[{'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.17030209302902222}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.1571504920721054}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.14325794577598572}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.11692902445793152}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.09316607564687729}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.07918375730514526}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.05569808930158615}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.0317874476313591}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.027870429679751396}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.02765548788011074}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.0251151230186224}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.023971250280737877}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.013751442544162273}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.011285163462162018}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.011054282076656818}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.009455572813749313}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.00843076128512621}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.007948311977088451}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.0063554286025464535}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.006277513224631548}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.006211200729012489}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.005654098466038704}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.003954954445362091}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.0029501081444323063}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.002734675770625472}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.0017246437491849065}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.0005398160428740084}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.0005257366574369371}]]"
"Ever been attracted to someone you hate? I find I have this strange attraction towards people I hate. A lot of times I’ll find them to be really annoying at first, like I just wish they’d disappear. Yet, at the same time, I find myself being attracted to them. 

The first time I can clearly recall this happening I was around 12 or 13. I didn’t have any initial attraction towards this guy at first. Then he like pushed me out of a seat or something and we just ended up sitting together on this small bench but I found myself strangly liking that he pushed me. I would ask him to play this game with me where we’d hit each other on the back of the hand until one of us tapped out from the pain. I’d always ask him to stop being so soft and hit me harder and I he did. I didn’t like him as a person, but I wanted him so bad. 

There was this other guy who would literally talk such disrespectful shit about me from across the room so I could hear him. I literally hated him but at the same time I was so attracted to him. 

Now that I’m in college, if I feel this vibe, I will steer clear from it despite the fact we may have an unspoken, intense attraction towards each other.

"Wanting to get pregnant impulsively without telling my partner? Help! Guys I’m really struggling. Recently I’d had loads of pregnancy symptoms and was worried I was pregnant. I have a coil but I know there’s a tiny tiny chance I could have been. Took a test and obviously wasn’t.
However ever since this happened I’ve just been fixated on the idea of getting pregnant, almost to the point of obsession. I know it’s just some weird impulsive and must be a BPD thing because I know that I am not in the place to have a baby right now. I’m only 21, not finished uni, I’m not even in a proper relationship as we’ve only been seeing each other for a month, I struggle to even look after myself and I’m always broke. I know I can’t take responsibility for another human life. I know this idea stuck in my head is completely ridiculous and crazy. 
Yet this urge won’t pass and I don’t know what to do- do I just ride it out? Do I talk to someone about it? I’ve tried googling but not found anyone in a similar situation.

"Not sure what I should do, I think I need someone else's perspective So I've made another self destructive, catastrophic entry to the world of dating again, and here I am. I have been seeing this girl for a few weeks, and we've made plans to have a movienight tomorrow, but I'm just feeling really bad about it :( We met on tinder, had a really fun first date, she sent me loads of cute texts after that, our second date was nice but not like the best ever? we still texted a lot after and arranged a new date, but these past few days she just seems more and more disinterested. Shorter, less frequent texts even tho they are still very sweet. The last text I got today I got like a day and a half after sending mine. She said sorry for being distant the last few days and that she's been busy, but she's looking forward to seeing me tomorrow. 

And I mean that's okay of course, I know people are busy and can't always respond right away, but at the same time I feel like if you are seeing someone new and you're really into them you'd show more interest, right? I just get the feeling that she's not that interested anymore - why else would you stop communicating as frequently etc? :-\ I'm scared that if I go tomorrow I'll just disappoint and end up disappointed, because I can't get this gnawing feeling that she doesn't like me to go away. I'm scared and I just want to text her and tell her that it's not gonna work for me bye bye. But I don't know if that is the right thing to do... I mean I can't read her thoughts, I don't know what's been happening in her life, but at the same time all of this still just makes me feel bad and unwanted, why should I feel like that? I guess it's not reasonable to expect constant validation either, though...

"Nightmares Ever since I was 15 years old I have had periods of intense/terrifying nightmares. Once they start, they last for about a month. Every time I go to sleep I have a nightmare, and I will wake up multiple times throughout the night, only to go back to sleep to another one. After a while it will turn into insomnia, because I am just too scared to sleep. The nightmares are often about demonic possession, or extreme acts of violence (think “Saw”). Does anyone else have experience with this? Is there anything that can help? Weed isn’t an option, because I am on methadone. Thanks for the advice in advance.

"happy endings my fp and boyfriend of 7 months recently snapped. i've been pushing him and pushing him and pushing him this whole time without really realizing it or intending to. he thought he could help me (diagnosed, previously hospitalised and medicated for a few years, now receiving no treatment because i'm terrified of going back on anti-psychotics) and i wanted him to be able to but things have been so bad lately, he told me that if i didn't get help he'd have to cut me out of his life completely. 

he sent me links to this subreddit, one about dealing with loved ones with bpd, and one on long distance relationships (i live in hawaii, he lives in massachusetts).

i looked over the one about pwbpd first. he warned me that it would be harsh and it really, really was. there's a lot of people saying people with bpd are crazy, they're all the same, run away as soon as you meet one, they will ruin your life, etc. if someone says they want to be with someone with bpd or they encouraging giving someone with bpd a chance, they get flamed. i think it's more so a support group for people who have been abused by people with bpd, rather than a place for advice on how to have a healthy relationship with someone that has bpd. i did get some amount of perspective from it, though. 

so idk, i was wondering if anyone here has any positive experiences or happy endings with a loved one. i want to find the motivation to change and get better but it's hard when it feels like i'm seen as a bad person who just can't change. but people with all kinds of mental illnesses are able to live normal happy lives with good fulfilling relationships, so why would this be the one thing that's hopeless?","[[{'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.2737357020378113}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.19147153198719025}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.15179035067558289}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.12614795565605164}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.11739072948694229}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.07998418807983398}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.06723685562610626}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.04978295415639877}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.03768572211265564}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.03662554547190666}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.034554529935121536}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.02907494455575943}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.023418210446834564}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.021280210465192795}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.010979111306369305}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.007871119305491447}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.006109369918704033}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.005599538795650005}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.005530630704015493}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.004578730091452599}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.0038040895015001297}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.0036433290224522352}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.0033282721415162086}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.002568471245467663}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.002354153199121356}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.0008995591197162867}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.0004835996369365603}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.00025538576301187277}]]"
"I want to write a character with BPD Hi guys,

I’m a writer, and I want to write a character that canonically has BPD. However, I don’t have BPD myself. I want this character to portray the disorder in an accurate light, with the goods and the bads. That said, I would really appreciate it if you all could answer a few questions for me.

What is BPD like for you?
What are the common misconceptions?
How much does the BPD affect you?
Would you say that your BPD defines you?
How does BPD make YOU act?

Thanks!","[[{'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.5654010772705078}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.42882269620895386}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.23896194994449615}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.03991877660155296}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.03480430319905281}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.03403441235423088}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.030897511169314384}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.027321306988596916}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.022268861532211304}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.014201696030795574}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.011217714287340641}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.007863419130444527}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.005600842647254467}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.005299855954945087}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.003950623329728842}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.003770063864067197}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0037569627165794373}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.003648856421932578}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.0035311414394527674}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.003268855158239603}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.002389715751633048}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.0021449325140565634}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.002028966322541237}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.0018458631820976734}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.0015157689340412617}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.0011085337027907372}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.0009530562674626708}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.0008247331134043634}]]"
"Advice with my marriage I just made this account to post here, because my husband knows my other account. I am extremely uncomfortable posting on here, but I don't know where else to go.

How do you know it is time to end a relationship versus just stupid BPD craziness? I do not know what to do, and am very confused. I idealized him at first, but ended up splitting. We've managed to come back from that for the most part, but I still don't love him the same way. We are great friends, but I do not think he is the right partner for me. We are opposites in most every way. I try to work on it, and we started marriage counseling in November. The more counseling we do, though, the less I want to put in any effort. 

He has a lot of his own issues that are only just now being worked on. I feel like I am stuck and have to take care of him. I want to leave. I also feel incredibly selfish for wanting to leave, as it would fuck up so many lives, my own included. I've caused so much damage throughout my life because of my BPD, and now I want to cause more just because I'm unhappy? What if I will just never be happy? And I'm terrified of being alone. With my husband, I have a stable, beautiful house, I was able to quit my job and go back to school, my family loves him. He'll eventually be transferred, which means I'll get to see new places just like I want. 

My life is exactly what I want, except for him. I want nothing to do with him. We've never had a great sex life and opened our relationship up because of it. That solves the sex issue, but it makes me disappointed with him even more and shows me that we are incompatible. Am I supposed to keep working on this because it is just my BPD being stupid?

How do I get the courage to leave, if I should? I'm terrified of being alone. I know he will never leave me, as he is incredibly codependent and loves me more than anything. If I leave, I'll lose my entire life. Everything will change and that is terrifying. I don't know what I'll do. Should I stay and just resolve myself to being unhappy? What if I switch and decide I can be happy with him? I don't trust my emotions or my brain anymore.","The expanded size of the tensor (516) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.  Target sizes: [1, 516].

"Want to contact my ex...because I am bored and know he will tell me he misses me. So my ex and I dated for 6 months and then he moved about 16 hours away. I knew he was going to move and didn't care. He always held me when I was upset and would always validate me. 

Shortly after he moved, I was sexually assaulted. I told him and said I needed to be with him, so he flew me down to him. We spent a night together. I was messed up because I wasn't sleeping at the time. I was slurring my words, stumbling, couldn't think straight. I think this scared him away. He was supposed to go to work the next day, then come pick me up and take me back to the airport..but he lied and told me he couldn't leave work. So I had to get a taxi back to the airport. I was so upset. 

I sent him an email saying we couldn't be in contact anymore and I needed time to work on myself. He never answered and I haven't contacted him at all since July. 

But last night I had a dream about him and I texting. I want his attention. He would always tell me how much he wants me and how beautiful I am. I am so bored today. I keep going to text him and then erase it. 

This is bad. I need to be alone and work on myself.

"My SO has been protecting me from emptiness, and I didn't know. A feeling of emptiness was a symptom I thought I had never experienced until now. But the truth is, my SO made it disappear long before I was diagnosed or started to try and understand the mess that is my emotions and thought-processes.

I'm currently overseas for study/holiday. My boyfriend of 9 years has not come with me. He has been my favourite person - my true favourite person for the entire time I've known him. Today is 28 days that we've been apart, the longest ever since we started dating. And the emptiness is back full throttle. My symptoms are at peak, and I'm having to work so hard to maintain control of my impulses and reactions - and I haven't even been doing that well. I've been isolating myself to stop from screaming at people, have felt overwhelmingly vulnerable and sensitive, punishing myself by walking in the freezing cold weather without gloves or a beanie, crying pathetically, endured a few particularly strong suicidal days, once even had a good friend stay on a video call with me so I could feel some semblance of comfort while trying to sleep, gave into my binge drinking urges, and even have been flirting a little with people in a sick desperation to fill this emptiness. I regret the last of these the most. It makes me feel sick, but the compulsion is so strong.

I never realised how much his presence in my life gave it meaning, or how valued he is to me as the ONLY person in my life that I feel truly comfortable with. No matter how much fun I'm having, no matter how happy I am, it just doesn't compare to the feeling of complete and utter acceptance and belonging that I feel with him. Between every happy moment is a painful feeling that I'm not complete. That it would be more, mean more, if he were here too. Constantly trying to fight the impression that it means nothing without him.

It all just tells me that I'm not me without him. Which is devastating. My identity should not be wrapped up in his so completely. To know that I am less without him...that I feel incomplete. I feel a deep, crushing void inside of me without him. And it's terrifying.","[[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.7364961504936218}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.23323576152324677}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.06789900362491608}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.03828604146838188}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.028985170647501945}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.023302460089325905}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.021834177896380424}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.019410256296396255}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.016966745257377625}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.015360292047262192}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.011701421812176704}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.011474870145320892}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.00865493156015873}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.00760817714035511}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.007155122701078653}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.006170079577714205}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.005787339992821217}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.005345653742551804}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.003831453388556838}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.003764251247048378}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.0031788356136530638}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.002964494051411748}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0025258678942918777}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.002267534611746669}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.0018521536840125918}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.00182939728256315}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.001480244449339807}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.0012497069546952844}]]"
"more comfortable around the opposite sex? as long as I can remember I have felt more at ease around men.

"Doctor prescribed me antidepressants for reflux... I'm feeling really hurt Heya. I ranted about this in Finnish already, but I'm still so pissed off from it. I don't know if I'm reacting so badly to it because of the BPD or something. I just feel like nobody is listening and want to get it off my chest. 

A bit of background info: I have GERD, reflux, diagnosed after an endoscopy which showed the doctors a hiatal hernia back in 2015 or 2016. I didn't have much symptoms back then, and they have gradually become worse. First I only had stomach pain; then I had more burping. Nowadays I suffer from constant burping, very frequent hiccups (which hurt!), bad heartburn, super bad spitting issue (I need to spit multiple times within an hour, otherwise my mouth fills up slowly. I feel nauseous when I swallow it), food coming back up to my mouth after eating it, nausea, pain in stomach etc. The list goes on, and it's definitely affecting my daily life since I have issues going to the store because of this!

Well, In January, I went to the doctors the first time to get help to the issue after trying numerous anti-reflux meds at home. They prescribed me PPIs, and said if the thing continues after a month come back. So I did. I went back there. And this time I had another doctor, a guy who probably was barely 30. 

So first off, the guy checked my symptoms and said ""well there's nothing abnormal in your body"", well okay, fine. But the previous doctor said it's reflux. I was trying to tell him the symptoms and that they get bad and then he just checked my medical history and said ""well, you have depression and OCD diagnosed"". Uhh ok, yes? What has that to do with my reflux getting worse? 

""Well I'm gonna prescribe you antidepressants. Your issue is just OCD."" WTF.

I tried to argue no, that's definitely not OCD because I keep waking up in the middle of the night at 4am to me covered in spit with the feeling a demon is being birthed through my stomach. But no, my doctor stopped listening after that. He was prescribing me fucking antidepressants and he was adamant on doing so.    
(Note: I'm going to therapy, and they want me to take SSRI for OCD, BPD, and the depression. This guy described me 25mg of an Amitriptyline for ""reflux"" and depression.)

Then I asked him, well, how about allergy tests then because I start throwing up, my mouth starts itching and my stomach flips me the bird whenever I drink milk - this would be so I can give the proof to my schools and work so I can avoid it, so I wouldn't get too many sick days from just eating the wrong food. No, he said straight out ""I won't order that for you because you aren't getting an anafylactic shock from it, your symptoms aren't sever enough"". At this point he wrote out the antidepressants and a stronger PPI medication to me (despite the fact that I said the previous doctor said I can only take a month of PPIs before I need to stop for a while). 

I put my prescription in the bag and said ""yeah I'll try them out then. Thanks."" but the guy then started talking to me like I was out taking coffee with him! ""Where are you studying"" ""What do you want to study"" ""What do you want to be when you're older"" etc, stuff that had **NO RELATION** to my issue. I wanted not to be rude so I kept responding to him but he kept smiling and laughing at me and I felt really uncomfortable; maybe because I cannot read humans, but I had already started to pack and be ready to leave, and it felt like he didn't want me to leave. I was really uncomfortable and anxious and in the end I just checked my clock and said ""well I'm gonna go now, I'll try the meds"" again and just almost ran out of the room. 

The best part? 

I checked what diagnosis he had given me. ""OCD"".

Fuck you. It's not OCD. I have diagnosed OCD. I know what hell OCD is, this is not OCD.

I spent the whole night crying at home when people like my parents kept barraging me (as usual) with stuff like ""Yeah see! It's all between your head"" and ""Well now you know it's not you being wrong! You need to fix your head first!"" and despite yelling them to shut up they didn't. And of course, since they heard what the doctor said when they forced me to tell them, they've been telling me ""Yeah but it's depression look how grumpy you are all the time"" ""Yeah but you aren't even telling us you love us anymore"" oh geez I wonder why. (I could rant about this too, but this is it's own category...) 

It's not depression. I can barely keep my food down due to the pain I get from eating and how much comes back up again, involuntarily. This isn't something I can control. I want to eat. I'm hungry. But it hurts. 

And then they wonder why I'm BPD.

Girlfriend never opens up to me but other dudes she's slept with Title is like it says. Suffering from bpd in a bad way. I have a habit of going through her phone because of past trauma and bpd and I always find her confiding in and actively engaging in actual conversation with guys she's slept with and all I ever get is maybe sentence or two. It's like she doesn't even love me. We're having a child together but I doubt the relationship will last long. She doesn't understand my concerns and doesn't realize there's a stark difference in level of engagement between past lovers and me and even my therapist understood. ,"[[{'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.5931581258773804}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.2545357644557953}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.2240096628665924}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.08380712568759918}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.06637555360794067}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.05902072414755821}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.04791684076189995}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.017774786800146103}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.017620040103793144}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.013244310393929482}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.010593539103865623}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.009369127452373505}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.005366107914596796}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.0048777200281620026}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.004723529331386089}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.004634730983525515}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0039189462549984455}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.0038349474780261517}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.0035753846168518066}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.0028628348372876644}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.0028248107992112637}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.002733630361035466}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.0016603342955932021}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.0013991105370223522}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.0009001258877106011}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.0006763125420548022}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.0005084062577225268}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.0004727041523437947}]]"
"I had sex with my FP This isn't the first time. We were together for 5 months until I left her on new years eve. I walked out her door after she warned me that doing so would be the last time, it would be over. And I did it anyway. 

I violated her trust and did the one thing she asked me time and time again not to do. She made me so happy, yet terrified. She's the only one I ever felt completely vulnerable for and it scared the hell out of me. 

I cut contact with her for a couple weeks before I caved and messaged her again. She's always been forgiving so I knew she would take me back because she must miss me. I was wrong. If it was one or two days she admitted that she would. But now she will never give me the power to hurt her again. It's fair and I don't deserve to be forgiven. 

We've managed to stay on friendly terms and be able to text and I have been begging to see her for weeks and been rejected.

In one of our daily texts she mentions that she is not doing well. She's miserable, she's alone all the time and feels worthless. I relate and ask to see her, she's hesitant but I've been on my best behavior so this time she doesn't refuse.
I show up at her house and run up her stairs to her kitchen and hug her as tight as I can. She hugs me back and it's the best feeling I could imagine. She pours herself a glass of wine and I ask her to join me on the couch.

We talk for about an hour and I make her laugh and I hold her and move in closer and try to kiss her and she kisses me back. Things get heavy and we move upstairs and stay in her bed for hours. I ask if I can stay just for the night and she agrees, but that this changes nothing. I agree that I understand her terms.
The next morning I leave for work and tell her that I'll always be around when she needs me.

That was two days ago and now I'm back to feeling terrible. Spending my Friday night in bed because it hurts so much and I want to hug her again. 
I'm beginning to think she used me for sex, like that was the last thing she needed before she would be able to cut me out of her life for good. She'll barely talk to me now and she's out with her friends all weekend. It seems like the only thing that would get her attention is if I had a date with someone or if I tell her I'm cutting contact. 
She has me right where she wants me and I'll be there for her when it's convenient and it's killing me. If I cut things off with her then I'll truly have no one to talk to but I'm hurting so much right now cause I need her and she doesn't need me at all. How do I move past this urge to get her attention by maliciously telling her I won't be around anymore?","The expanded size of the tensor (642) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.

"Not the same as others with BPD.. I'm not sure if this is allowed because I've been diagnosed and have been for close to a decade by different therapists and professionals. I'm going to start writing a book, and I'm unsure if i should even say ""borderline"". I feel like I'm lying.  My mental struggles are a central part of what i intend to write so it would be hard to exclude it but feeling like a liar is making me not write it at all.  How could i say that and not be much like anyone i know with BPD. I essentially want to know if others feel this way.... have been diagnosed but feel like they don't meet criteria. If so,  maybe they are right and I shouldn't feel bad when i start writing.  

How i am typical for someone with bpd:
-i have severe abandonment issues.  Following my father's death shortly before i turned 14 i was shipped across the country. I ran away from home multiple times and made my way back to NY from Florida looking for him.  I can not get over anything that shows I'm unwanted by someone i fancied (romantic or platonic) if i can not understand why.  For example,  i was blocked by a friend what i enjoyed after a night hanging out. I have obsessed over that person since to the point i had to look up stalking laws to make sure i wasn't doing anything terrible. 

-i can and do blend in with anyone I'm around as long as I'm alone with them. I'm a sponge and i am no one often times. 

-i have a history of self harm but it is usually because of desperate attempts to keep a loved one around. Ex: ""I'll prove it to you. See? That's your name carved in! No one would ever see me again and not know you!"" Or very much having every intent to carry out ""i would live and die for you"". I also have weird weird weird urges that aren't related to that.  Like cutting under my breasts to try to make it look like there's more shadow via a scar,  or randomly (but often) wanting to cut my mouth.  I'm here enough to not allow myself.  

- intense anxiety.  This is usually due to either a very severe phobia i have that has ruled my life,  fear of abandonment, fear of loved ones not being alright,  and anticipating people being angry with me.  

-i chronically feel empty. 

Ways i do not qualify as a person with BPD:

-I do not have anger problems. I just broke my no- yelling- steak after 13 YEARS. I run from fights,  arguments scare me,  i can't do confrontation. 

- my relationships are not unstable. I do not go from loving someone to hating them, even when i probably should. In this area i am opposite of what i know of BPD. I will go to any lengths to stop someone from leaving. Literally will beg on hands and knees. I'll throw all my money at them and promise to be anything they want,  then do it. But then there's never the opposite. The devaluation part. I've been with my husband for 9 years and we nearly never argue and there's been no instability. 

-i am not dissociative ever,  i don't think. I have had a couple psychotic breaks though.  





The anger and unstable relationships is such a big part that for me to be the complete opposite i feel like I'm false advertising to say i have bpd. Does anyone have core parts of BPD missing but are diagnosed and are sure the doctors were right? Like i said,  its been several that diagnosed it but it doesn't feel right.

"Pushing People away So i saw a post talking about people self victimizing and wanted to make sure its not me. Its long, but please read it.

I have depression and bpd and over the years i realized that no matter how hard i tried i wasnt going to please anyone else or myself. If i did something to be mindful, it would somehow be called out as bad judgement and id be in the wrong. Any mistake was/is deemed on purpose and made me selfish. So i determined that i should just be alone. I met nice people but i am a stain. Whenever they did nice things for me i hated myself for it and when they wouldnt let me pay it back i hated them. I thought theyd hold it against me. The guilt ate at me so i said horrible things to them to get them to hate me too. I distanced myself. The only thing i regret is how i said it. But i cant go back to them. Even now as im in college i plan on leaving after graduating so not even family can find me.  I just dont want to hurt anyone anymore and go into a field where i can help.

"5 Months Without A Major Emotional Episode... then I screwed up once and it started a downward spiral. Five months doesn't seem like a long time, but for me it really was. Five months without splitting, acting impulsively, disassociating, or having an emotional outburst. Five months without obsessing over things, fixating, or becoming irrationally attached. Five months of stable, healthy, pretty normal behavior.

Then I got triggered. And had a moment. I split, disassociated, resorted to pathological lying to get attention. It wasn't my worst moment ever. I've had way worse. But it was a moment and now I feel myself losing control. It's like if I f*** up one time, I fall into a rut and just spiral into a bunch of bad behavior. It's so freaking hard to pull my life together once I've messed up once. I fixate on the fact I've messed up and persuade myself I'm worthless and can't do better.

Rationally, I know I can do better. I have for 5 months. But BPD urges are strong.

"Recently diagnosed with BPD and having a hard time coping I just moved cities and when my depression started becoming unbearable again, i went to a LCSW I had never seen before. She and an APRN diagnosed me with BPD. I had no idea what it was. I did some research and i agree with the diagnosis. 

For some reason that I can't really explain, I feel like my world has been completely flipped upside down. I had already been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and ADD and i had come to terms with that. Now I'm 23 and just added another mental health problem to the list. I read articles and Reddit threads from people who dated girls with BPD and they all made it out to be the worst experience of their life. I suddenly feel unlovable although I have a very caring, patient, and understanding boyfriend that has taken this news better than I could have ever imagined. 

After reading the symptoms of BPD and recognizing them as they've happened in the past week, I feel like being aware of them is making them worse. I feel more unstable than before. As if I have an excuse for my irrational feelings now even though I know that's wrong. 

My LCSW gave me the DBT workbook but I have yet to go over it with her. As a side note, I'm not sure I really even like her. She just rubs me the wrong way. Should i get a different one? 

I guess I'm just looking to talk to some people with BPD and i need some reassurance that its not the end of the world. 

TL;DR: recognizing my symptoms are making them worse, I don't like my therapist, and I'm in need of a success story to get my hopes up.","[[{'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.2967250943183899}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.26702481508255005}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.2442675232887268}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.16829778254032135}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.1239476278424263}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.08806805312633514}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.06409233063459396}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.04296635463833809}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.038005851209163666}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.028298625722527504}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.027914978563785553}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.020991774275898933}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.014722269959747791}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.012434895150363445}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.012120461091399193}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.010187509469687939}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.010063164867460728}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.010059033520519733}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.009243404492735863}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.007482078857719898}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.00702505512163043}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.00645821588113904}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.005051624495536089}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.004275286570191383}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0028405343182384968}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.002258396241813898}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.001383756403811276}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.0006254548789002001}]]"

"Help me use my wise mind right to figure out what treatment steps I need to take next Hi everyone

It's pretty hard for me to even post here, considering I really struggle with what this diagnosis means for my life and the stigma it attaches to me. 

I am not doing well. I have not been doing well for three years now because of an interpersonal rejection that actually somewhat broke me as a human being.  

In the tldr of it since this event, I have gained about 30-40kg, lost most of my friends (through bad behaviours or self isolation from fear of losing or hurting them), had to extend my graduation and I haven't gotten a job in my field yet. I am so paranoid of everyone in my town hating me / me having a reputation from the bad behaviours I engaged in during crisis that I am so deeply ashamed... I just avoid everyone.

I have also developed some classical O-OCD obsessions in the past year to accompany my usual diagnoses of BPD/depression/anxiety. 

Everyday I torture myself by repeating to myself that I am fat, I am friendless, I am bad and that I have no future or career.

It's hard, to say the least.

My self esteem has never been lower, my hope for the future has never been worse and my life is entirely lacking in authentic human connection. I enjoy nothing and I do not want to do anything.

((It wasn't always like this - although I have always had these issues it has never ever been this bad. In fact, for most of my life I have been very popular, thin and an overachiever. ))

But nobody seems to be seeing how fucking hard I've been having it now, because they are comparing me to CRISIS MODE INSANITY post abuse to now (I am working, living out of home, not engaging in bad coping strategies). Everyone around me is telling me how much better I seem to be doing. 

And I get it, I have improved a lot from that place. But I am so far from where a normal person would ever be? Where I was, where my trajectory was taking me?

I think a large part for this is that I have learned to control acting immediately out of my emotions, stopped seeing anyone (so they can't see how hard it is) and have quit social media.

But I can't take this feeling anymore, and it's getting worse. It hurts so bad and I am SO lonely. My life right now is SO FAR from where I thought it would be or where I would hope it would be. I am absolutely miserable and I am not overexagerrating when I say there is no reprieve, even for a moment. Everyday for 3 years has been filled with absolute distress.  

I don't understand what else I can do here to improve my situation at this point, but I am DESPERATE to do something.

I am in individual therapy and have been in two lots of 12 week group DBT courses. I am seeing a psychiatrist semi-regularly and I am on agomelatine. 

I am struggling to articulate how bad this is to my DBT psychologist - I often times feel like she is not taking my pain seriously because I am not suicidal / acting out / acting ""borderline"" / engaging in immediately unhealthy coping mechanisms. 

Does anybody have advice on how I can improve this? What else I can do? What can I say to my caretakers? How do I break this slump? How do I get back to my old self?

My heart goes out to all of you - reading the advice threads on board helps keep me grounded and makes me feel like maybe one day I will be strong enough to cope like you. Thank you for helping me develop the skills I need.


**tldr**

I am in DBT and am medicated... but my life still sucks. What else can I do?","The expanded size of the tensor (845) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.  Target sizes: [1, 845].  Tensor sizes: [1, 514]"
"I'm shit at making decisions. Do i keep trying or do i give up. Alright I'll try to keep this brief. But lol I am not that good at that. Also just like everyone, I've had a very complicated and eventful past.

I'm in love with my ""ex"". I don't like using that word. We dated for ~1.5 years. The first time I feel like I ever really felt love (I don't think I love my family or ever have. I don't truly love any of my friends but I'm getting there with one). 

Classic bpd person, I went through so many cycles of love and hate and anger and depression and extreme anxiety and accusations and threats and manipulation and emotional abuse. Classic.

We broke up in late November. We went a month or so basically no contact. But we talk a lot now. I don't want to lose him. I still love him. I know he still cares about me and has feelings for me despite the fact that he won't say it (he's a strong believer in repressing emotions. Classic). 

Last night we hung out. I thought I could handle it. I could be friendly with him. We drank some wine. I cried. I told him I missed him. I told him I loved him. I asked for another chance even though I know I don't deserve it. He told me he wasn't ready. That I was making him uncomfortable. That he was giving me a chance. That he needed to get to know me again and trust me again before wanting to get more involved again. He ""needs time to process"" all the hurt I've caused. He needs to trust that I won't hurt him again like I have. 

I can't promise that to him right now. I've made a lot of strides in managing things (at least my actions, thoughts not so much yet) these past 7 months. Meds and consistent therapy has really helped. He said, ""either you really have changed and I need time to get to know you again and trust you or you're still the same person and just trying to convince me otherwise like you've done so many times"".

""Be patient"", he says. ""I understand"", I reply. ""I don't know if I can do that"", I think to myself and don't say aloud.

""I'm afraid you will find someone new or just forget about me forever"" I say while sobbing. ""First off the latter won't happen and that's just your abandonment issues talking. And secondly I am not interested in anything with anyone right now so don't worry about that"".

I ruined my chance to start gradual and just be his friend and talk about this stuff when he's ready. I feel like such an idiot. This just set me back again. 

I know I am not mentally ready to be back with him. But I fucking want him back. He's not ready for that.

But is it even worth waiting? I know I'm attractive. I've hooked up with boys since him. And one of them had to call our hook-ups because he started to like me but knew I couldn't reciprocate.

But part of me wants to prove to myself that yes, I can wait. I am not a patient person. But I've changed. I know I have. Truly. I haven't been in a blind rage in maybe 1.5 months. That used to be a weekly occurrence. Anxiety and depression have decreased considerably. I still split on my friends when they don't reply to my texts, etc., but it's to a lesser degree. I'm so much more stable. I'm finding my passions again. I'm building my friendships that I abandoned in the past 2 years. I have changed. I know I've said that to him like 20 times. Or ""I can change"". But I really finally feel like I can. 

I also fucking love him. And I know he still cares about me and has feelings for me. And I just don't want to give up yet. Part of me wishes I would want to give up. But the bigger part wants to prove to me and him that I can fucking do this.

"Impulsivity - spending Lately within the last week i’ve been going through what seems like every “stage” of my BPD and i’m currently dealing with the impulses. I chopped off my hair after a shower, took out my favorite piercing, bought too many clothing items online, and I’m still itching for more. the small bit of gratification is overwhelming to me since lately it seems like nothing is going my way. 

I KNOW this won’t last, and soon i’ll be regretting spending so much money unnecessarily. rationally I know I shouldn’t be spending money on things that I don’t need. that being said, I guess my question is.. for those of you who have similar tendencies, how would you feel about having someone else “control” your money? i’m thinking maybe my husband should have “control” of all the funds so I don’t keep doing this. if I don’t have the access to the money I can’t spend it. but the BPD in me is screaming “are you kidding?!”.

"My DBT therapist is leaving me. Whirlwind. Is my trauma even real trauma? I’ve come to this forum because honestly I’m feeling lost and like no one around me quite understands. Hoping kindred spirits can help shed some light. 
Last week my DBT therapist told me he was leaving for another job in 2 weeks, after roughly 5 months of working with me.
Since that moment, all the hard work I’ve put in to creating a semblance of order and peace in my life has just gone out of the window. I feel like I was really starting to make some progress but the news has shaken my foundations and as a result I’ve been thrown into whirlpools of confusing emotions and thoughts on a daily basis. The panic attacks/overwhelming crises were starting to dissipate but are back again in full force, and even harder to deal with now I have a job and other obligations that I had, until now, been able to keep up with. 
I’ve met with my new therapist once, and he seems very much on my wavelength, so I know hope is not lost. But it will take time to build a relationship with him.
And in the meantime, I have been trying to analyse this shitstorm of emotions myself... It’s too much to begin to express, yet a single thought (epiphany?) has been replaying in my mind.
BPD/C-PTSD/Panic disorder (my diagnoses) are all rooted in trauma, and I will soon be receiving EMDR on top of DBT (aaaall the anacronyms).
I am going to have to delve into the painful experiences that have caused my negative thought patterns. But these experiences aren’t actually that traumatic? 
I’ve been put down and invalidated by a series of friends since childhood, at it’s very worst I’d say it was emotional bullying (being told I am pathetic, weak, annoying, worthless, ugly, abrasive, being avoided, talked about, standard teenage bullshit). I’ve never been physically abused and I have incredibly loving parents. 
When I consider the extremity of my issues now it just doesn’t make sense. What happened to me has happened to most people in their lives. Why has something so insignificant caused me to literally start hyperventilating and hitting myself when I drop a spoon because I suddenly think I’m so awful as a human being I deserve to die (and it’s painful to live)? 
I feel like I’m living some kind of lie and really I just am this shit, worthless person who can’t deal with reality.
I don’t know what’s real in my self and I don’t have a supportive figure to help me figure it out anymore, so I guess I’m seeking some kind of external validation that trauma doesn’t  have to be physical or extreme to have a huge impact on your psyche.
I don’t want to start blaming myself for this sickness again. :(
Sorry for the word vomit, I hope it’s okay to pop up and ask for support like this, I’m in a bit of a weird interim. Thanks x","The expanded size of the tensor (693) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.  Target sizes: [1, 693].  Tensor sizes: [1, 514]"
"My friends (all male, 24s) had a talk with me (23, F) about my “clevage”. Yesterday I invited my 3 male friends over for dinner. One of them (let’s call him T, came in early for helping me out). T and I used to have feelings for each other but I ended up cheating on him (several times). We did not talk for years but currently we are trying to be friends again even though he still has feelings for me. The other two friends are originally T’s friends from high school but I am currently trying to be friends with them too.

Anyway, the other friends came and we played several games and had small talks. During the conversations I constantly checked my phone since I am trying to create an online magazine about literature and I am really occupied by incoming e-mails. Then we went out to grab a coffee. It was my neighbourhood so I was leading the way and I was walking in front of them. One of my friends told me to slow down several times and I did but I am a fast-walker and I was ahead of them again and again.

The evening ended pretty well (at least that’s what I thought until I got a text from T at 3.00 am telling me that we needed to talk tomorrow and that it is very important). I met him today and he told me that they were really uncomfortable with me constantly checking my phone and was not really “there” and that they felt “unwanted”. While T and I were alone I was again emailing people so why did I call him to come in early to help me out etc. He then told me that my t-shirt was not appropriate and they all felt uncomfortable because of seeing my “boobs and bra”. They all know that I have Borderline Personality Disorder and T also knows that I used to use my sexuality in order to have more intimacy with people (which is true for people that I am flirting with but I would never try to do that with a friend). So he accused me of trying to use my sexuality so that I could manipulate them to be closer to me emotionally.

I was really hurt by all of this because I did not show off my bra intentionally and the way he put it was not kind. He also showed some texts where he talked with the other male friends and they were joking about my aunt being bipolar, telling me I am somehow “crippled” etc. I tried to laugh it off and did not say much but I really feel hurt. How do I talk to T and my other friends about this? Should I end or somehow restrict the friendship?

tl;dr: My friends came in for dinner and was really uncomfortable with my dress since they could see my bra and boobs and they thought I was doing this intentionally. One of them had a talk with me about this and I am really hurt now. How do I continue my friendship? Should I end it?

"Every single friendship I've ever had has ended terribly. I have never had a healthy relationship in my life. I've had 6-7 best friends throughout my lifetime. Every single one has ended on terribly traumatic terms. 

Years ago, I used to point the finger at them, and only share some of the blame with myself. Now I'm becoming aware of this pattern which is making me really reflect on myself and my actions that may be causing this problem.

When a friendship ends, it affects me deeply and feels like 1000 pounds of guilt and loneliness dumped on me at once. 

Most recently, one of my best friends, who knows about my BPD and told me she would be supportive and understanding about it, dropped out of my life because I changed my mind about wanting to be roommates with her. It was shitty of me and I held myself accountable for that poor decision. I asked her to forgive me and understand, and I told her I don't want it to ruin our friendship. She (seemingly) forgave me and we talked a bit after that. Suddenly, she starts ditching and ignoring me. She didn't even have the audacity to explain why or at least tell me how she feels. And to make matters worse, in the meantime, she suddenly became best friends with another ex-best friend of mine that ended terribly as well. So now I get to see these two (who hate me) suck each other's asses on social media while I'm alone, sulking like a little bitch on Reddit.

I can't figure it out and I am begging someone to give me a fucking wake up call. But my 'friends' rather just give up and bail. Why am I not worthy of someone just openly communicating with me?

 I don't know how to have a healthy relationship.","[[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.5848252177238464}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.3769240081310272}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.10812391340732574}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.028589561581611633}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.02700931951403618}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.024360328912734985}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.02419281378388405}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.020727936178445816}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.017257796600461006}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.016181807965040207}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.013880091719329357}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.013289348222315311}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.01275727804750204}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.008745784871280193}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.008227354846894741}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.006588601507246494}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.005454903934150934}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.0035013200249522924}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.003313309047371149}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0024944404140114784}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.0024718905333429575}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.0024396099615842104}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.002306587528437376}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.0016119972569867969}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.0014581062132492661}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.0013994049513712525}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.0005701241316273808}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.000511758669745177}]]"
Splitting with food I am currently going through diagnosis for BPD and also for a plethora of other things and an Eating Disorder. Today I recognized with my dietician that my emotional habits with food tend to fit “splitting” which I also tend to do which relationships. Select foods become safe foods and ones that are reliable to eat and then out of the blue or one bad occurrence and then they completely repulse me and are a fear food.

"Feeling Forced to Stop Meds About two weeks ago I suddenly developed neck spasms which became so severe that I had to go to the ER and get IV muscle relaxers and Ativan before I could even hold my head straight.  I've never experienced anything like this before and it was TERRIFYING.  I was on 4 mg of Risperdal a day at the time, and was having mild side effects like tics and tremors.  All the research that we did pointed to extra pyramidal side effects from the Risperdal, particularly the fact that it occurred in my neck.  I stopped the Risperdal immediately and informed my psychiatrist.  I'm scared to take anymore antipsychotics at all for fear of having another incident, and he hasn't put me on anything else, so I'm just going cold turkey.  I'm having a lot of rebound and withdrawal effects and life has been kind of hellish, to be honest.
Does anyone have any suggestions?  Be it other medications I could try or anything else?  I have been meditating and practicing some DBT techniques, but my day to day existence is still extremely uncomfortable.  I am lucky enough to have a scrip for 2 mg klonopin BID but often even that doesn't work. Also take 40 mg Prozac and 100 mg trazadone, just for a complete picture.  The Risperdal was very good at controlling my agitation and I'm a mess without it.

"Not a diagnosis request! I haven't been diagnosed with bpd even though I'm fairly certain it is why I am the way I am....

After years of anti depressants and counselling self harm and suicide attempts I got referred to a psychologist. We talked, in depth about my problems my past my feelings etc etc. 

She had me start practicing 'mindfulness' ... which she taught to me by having me examine a biro in minute detail, sniffing it looking at it from all angles and so on.

I felt like an idiot.

Anyway. After doing my own reading and my albeit limited psychology experience ( I studied it at a level and degree... just never finished the degree) I pressured her for a referral to be diagnosed. 

She didn't want to do it. She told me she felt I would use it as an excuse not to practice the mindfulness and consequently get better. 

I explained I was seeking validation for my feelings rather than being brushed off as 'over reacting'   it's so hard to explain to people that sometimes I genuinely feel as strongly as I do about things and that I'm not exaggerating... that when I'm angry I'm not going ott but genuinely feeling what I say I am so need the space I am requesting and so on

She reluctantly referred me to the personality disorder team to get a diagnosis which she cannot give.... 

My point is, is this a common occurance? A: reluctance to diagnose B: assumptions about your reactions/behaviours C: devaluing of your feelings/reactions etc?   

TL:DR my psych made me smell a biro to help me get better. Said don't need diagnosis because its an excuse.","[[{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.49049022793769836}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.1493617296218872}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.14580059051513672}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.09375853836536407}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.05409463495016098}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.04967626929283142}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.048653632402420044}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.027779797092080116}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.01667686738073826}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.007137495558708906}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.00615902803838253}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.005198987200856209}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.004575518891215324}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.004073227755725384}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.002736418740823865}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.0021111296955496073}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.0020724621135741472}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.0018680283101275563}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0015249352436512709}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.0011206441558897495}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.001094830222427845}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.0010914026061072946}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.0009244776447303593}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.0008750036358833313}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.0005722405039705336}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.0005017337389290333}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.0002779882925096899}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.00016544442041777074}]]"
"Hope for teenagers who exhibit BPD symptoms? Last February my sweet wife and I took in a 16 year old girl who exhibits symptoms of BPD. 




To say that this last year has been difficult is an understatement.




We constantly feel defeated. We feel unable to help her. But if we she leaves our home, her next stop is a group home hours away because she has no family that will take her.




We really love this girl and want to help her, but after a year of having her live with us, we feel like we have made very little progress and yet she has created a HUGE disturbance in our lives and the lives of our four other kids.




We are thisclose to having her leave. My sweet wife just listened to Stop Walking on Egg Shells and it gave her a lot more empathy for what must be going on in our daughter's head.  I'm 90 minutes into it and it's already been helpful.




She has not been officially diagnosed, nor will she be since she isn't 18. Last summer she had a psych eval done and it was pretty eye opening. We have a therapist who comes to our home weekly and that's been helpful. Later this moth we are taking her to her second meeting with a child psychologist who has the ability to prescribe meds, which our daughter is actually open to trying.

"You're doing well. You're doing well. And you. And you. And I'm doing well too.

I was just procrastinating and reading stories of other people. I started comparing some stuff with my own life. And to my shock I found that I did quite well. I moved out from an abusive home after years of depression. I dropped 60 lbs in a year through sheer willpower. I pass examinations with flying colors. And a weird impulse passed over me: I patted my own shoulder and said ""You're doing well"". And I started crying.

I struggled with self-hate from adolescence. I used to cut my arms and hit myself with a fist, put myself to sleep with drugs and alcohol, freeze on purpose. I never felt even a speck of love, sympathy or respect for myself. I see not one pretty thing in my body. I suck at self-care; to be honest I don't even know how to do it.

But at that one fleeting moment, I felt a bit of connection and compassion to myself. And I would love for you to feel it too. So please brag away what you did well. I'm eager to listen.

"What circumstances made you seek a diagnosis? I would appreciate hearing from those who have been diagnosed, because I would like to help someone go see a therapist.

From what I understand of BPD, some of the key symptoms seem to make things difficult for an individual to even come to terms that there might be a problem, and stay on a treatment plan once started. I would appreciate hearing about how some of you came to terms that there was a problem, and what steps did you take to make that initial appointment. Additionally, if you feel comfortable, I'd also appreciate hearing how you have been able to stay in therapy.

I do not want to go into details listing the symptoms because I DO NOT want a diagnosis nor do I want to seem like that is what I am seeking. However, I am struggling with an individual who I suspect has BPD, and I would like to be able to give them the most effective nudge in the right direction.

The reason I want to hear from those with a diagnosis of BPD is because I want to try to understand from your perspective, about the process of seeking treatment. 

Thank you in advance for any help you may provide.","[[{'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.5667771697044373}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.40699586272239685}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.29176270961761475}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.06256212294101715}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.054211098700761795}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.05055244639515877}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.029429737478494644}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.024727845564484596}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.023527147248387337}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.019920527935028076}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.011354362592101097}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.0077064912766218185}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.005866806488484144}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.0050296662375330925}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.004868817515671253}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.0040826392360031605}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.0037017969880253077}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.0036726908292621374}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.003400591667741537}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.002869381569325924}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.0026521007530391216}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.001718553132377565}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.001709599164314568}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.0014941912377253175}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.0012893700040876865}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.0012335511855781078}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.000975047005340457}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.0008359767962247133}]]"
"All of my worst fears came true I met an amazing guy, we hit it off straight away and it was like a romance I'd always dreamed of. Everything was going perfect until all of a sudden he got distant, and stopped replying. Of course the negative thoughts and self doubt told me ""that's it, you're not good enough, he's going to leave you"" but I thought logically and thought that actually, all of our interactions had been going really well and I had no reason to believe he was going to break up with me... And then it happened

""you are so amazing, you are such a fucking cool person... But there's just something missing and I don't even know what it is. I wish it didn't have to be like this""

So there we have it, even when everything is perfect and the person thinks I'm amazing, I'm still unlovable.

I want you guys to see what happens when you self medicate and don't try to get to the root of your anger, sadness and loneliness so maybe, just maybe I can save a life or two with my fucked up story and the life I lead that I'm trying so hard to get back. 

I'm sure you'll be able to relate. If Tumblr links are not allowed but you want to help me get it out there I will PM you the link. Otherwise i will make an edit here and post the link. I will be writing daily if it gets enough attention, someone following will help keep me accountable.

"I don't feel bad. I still don't do anything. I was in a rollercoaster of bad feelings and (mild) self destruction during the end of last year, on the brink of getting sent to the psych ward again (should have gone, honestly).

New medication kicked in (just Lamictal now) about 2 weeks ago I'd say. 

I don't feel bad anymore. I don't feel like murdering every single idiot that cuts me in traffic anymore, neither do I feel like I'm worthless and should die just because I tripped or something. Ok, I feel alright. I don't feel *bad* anymore. Mood swings relatively in check.  

My anxiety is still bad, however. I feel like I'm never outside of my head. Never ever. Like I can never 'be in the moment' because I'm in my head going over a hundred different thoughts at the same time. It gets worse at night when I'm trying to sleep hugging my SO and then I start to **not** feel my arms and progressively the rest of my body and ask myself ""oh is this dissociation?"" - btw is it? It's been a while, honestly... I felt like my *core* was unglued from my body last night. 

So, the only good person/thing (*cringe*) in my life went on a trip with family for a couple weeks this morning and I couldn't even connect enough for a decent goodbye. In fact I don't feel connected enough to my ""self"" writing this either, it's weird. I ""objectively"" feel like crying, but that's like looking at broken glass on the floor and stating ""it is broken"". 

Anyways, my living situation is hell since I'm not really a productive member of society and I am also not actually a ""crazy person"", I'm someone with ""character flaws"". I've been in university since forever struggling with my stupid head and losing. Now this opportunity to get a public service job to work at the university has appeared, and the admission exam is in April. I have plenty of time to study, and plenty of reasons. 

1) I love my girlfriend so much. She's my life partner. I got so lucky there. Definitely not where the worst part of my bpd hit. 

2) I'm not going to graduate so soon, still at least some 2 years to go since I keep failing classes due to lack of attendance. 

3) my living situation is hell and probably 80% of the reason why I'm so messed up (not really the house, more the inhabitants ;-) )

Pretty strong reasons, right? And let me stress again that **I don't feel depressed**. I can genuinely say I'm okay. 

And yet... Why did I spend the whole day smoking pot, binge eating, watching Netflix, and *not doing what I have to do to achieve the things I need in order to not be so miserable anymore*?! 

When I think ""I should pick up the laptop and start planning my studies for the exam"" *I* answer ""why?"" And honestly... I don't see purpose. I don't feel anything when I imagine not being able to achieve this, my way out. I just think... Nothing. I'd rather stay on the couch.

"Addictive tendancies and BPD I know that an ""addictive personality"" is pretty standard for someone with BPD, but does anyone else feel like they extend their addictive tendancies to literally *anything* in life?

If left to my own devices, I will latch onto whatever's available. Now that I'm alone, I've been drinking more than ever. It's routine now. Every time I have a rough day at work, I feel as though it's my ""treat"" to head to the pub and drink myself numb. I never say no to drugs, not caring who exactly is giving them to me. I have no self-control. I intentionally work as much as possible because doing doubles gives me this rush.

I've been a binge-eater since I was a child. In the last year I've gotten into a restriction/binge cycle, because apparently even starving myself is addictive. It's a mental high. I spend way too much time looking at pornography. Sometimes I blow people off just to stay home and masturbate. Everyone I meet who seems remotely interested in me is a target for sexual objectification. I crave the attention from every man, and it's impossible for me to have meaningful relationships with women because I see them as sexual objects.

But the thing is, my addiction isn't even exclusive to self-destructive activities/behaviours. When I was in good place, I was addicted to cleaning my/my SO's house. I was addicted to eating clean. I went to the gym almost every day. I was hyper-focused on being fit/healthy. I wanted to be a perfect housewife and had dinner ready for when he got home every night. I woke up early to pack him lunches and dressed up just to stay home with him. I spent so much time on my appearance...I had to be the absolute best.

It's like, I don't even have enough of a real personality or sense of self to choose my vice. I just get addicted to whatever's placed infront of me. Thus, feeding into my ""save me"" complex.

"Boyfriend is trying to force me to tell my anti-mental health family that I'm suicidal I attempted awhile ago and now have the ""normal"" BPD ideation. Before I made a promise not to attempt until I was 18 and I kept it and now I am promising myself to wait until I get mental health services from my college this August and I believe I will keep it. I've told my boyfriend too much and now he's forcing me to tell my mom or he'll tell her myself. I won't tell her, I think there's a 50/50 chance she'll get me help but a 100% chance my whole family will look down on me for it. I've spent a gap year doing nothing but getting more depressed and she's told me she can't even afford my food bill.  I've told her a few times in the past, begging to see a psychiatrist, and she's said I'm just being melodramatic. She also demonizes PDs since she believes my father has NPD and that's why he treated her like shit. It's even worse if my boyfriend tells her because she'll think I've lied to him and manipulated him. If she hears that he's also been depressed since we've started dating she'll blame me. I love her and she's not purposely malicious but she constantly dies things that further invalidate my self worth and she's just not someone I want to know about the state of my mental health. My dad's another can of worms but much worse. I understand my boyfriend is trying to do what's best for me but he's really making things much worse. I like having control and he's taking it away.

"I don't want to be ""red pill"" with her I have been going out with a girl that I really like for 3 weeks or so now. We don't text much during the week, which is very different for me. My relationships have always been the type where we talk constantly because I am unhealthy and gravitate towards unhealthy women and relationships. However, as much as I worry throughout the week that she is going to get bored of me/forget about me/ find someone new, every friday (so far) I have recieved a text from her confirming our plans for that night. Then, we hang out all weekend and it is really great. We get along and relate in all of the perfect ways. She has even helping me pick out a car, etc, making me believe she has plans of sticking around.

But I still have that nagging anxiety and fear of abandonment. I don't trust people-women especially. I've been big into ""the red pill"" and have been seeing that not caring and not showing emotional neediness is what keeps girls interested. But I really like this girl, and we haven't kissed yet. I really want to kiss her, and even though she knows that I really enjoy her company and like her as a person, I am not sure if she knows that I feel it in the romantic sense.

I'm stuck wondering what to do. One side of me wants to tell her how I feel, but the other side of me is scared like a little kid that she'll just go ""nah, this isn't working out. See ya."" Am I thinking in an unhealthy way? I have not been able to talk to anyone about this because I refuse to even ask her friends what they think out of fear that it will look needy and drive her away.

"Today I had to face that I didn't have loving support from anyone growing up and that it's fucked me up. Was at my therapist today. At one point I had to admit that I did not have any family that was loving and supportive after a certain age. Mum used to be but suffered some trauma and withdrew when I was abt 8. Dad abandoned us about the same age. Grew up with extended family which was a shitty, loveless and punitive environment. 

It hit me just now how growing up in a different country, different culture .. I never felt accepted or belonged. Most of the teachers in schools seemed to hate me for some reason. Only two I can recall were different. 

'Home' was a foster situation where they seemed to put up with us as some sort of cross to bear. Beaten often. Silenced often. Told to stop thinking and questioning back. 

Looking back I see that my mum had shown me love and support before the age of 8. If not for that I could have been a full sociopath. 

But no. I had a taste of what a love and support is like and then it was taken away.  So I grew up with a fucking gaping hole inside me. 

Today I was in a restaurant. I saw parents having dinners with teenage children. I never did. My mother and father couldn't get along. 

Is this self pity or sadness? It's just fucking overwhelming.","[[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.5267810821533203}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.45445042848587036}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.15174053609371185}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.05651294067502022}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.053928814828395844}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.03852648288011551}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.027800442650914192}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.024180270731449127}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.02327796258032322}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.018048027530312538}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.010447541251778603}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.009800659492611885}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.00908060371875763}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.008821217343211174}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.008782844059169292}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.008662356063723564}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.005535455886274576}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.005269988439977169}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.0039064278826117516}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.0034828598145395517}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.0032768098171800375}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.0030547946225851774}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.002156378235667944}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.0019227975280955434}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.0015107932267710567}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.0012405223678797483}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.0004014087317045778}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.0003566539380699396}]]"
"pwBPD-pwBPD Real-life Friendships/Support/Mentorship? Does anyone have experience with having a close relationship with another person with BPD, as a person with BPD yourself? I think I'm relatively high-functioning for the most part amongst my social circle 
 -- my BPD symptoms manifests mainly when I'm at home and interacting with my family -- and I don't feel ready to tell my friends about it yet due to the fear of judgment and/or invalidation. 


I've experienced rather strong suicide ideation lately and called a suicide hotline, and it really helped in the moment -- I sincerely recommend it for anyone who has suicide ideation as well! -- but I couldn't help but feel the kind person on the other end didn't/couldn't fully understand (it also isn't really a long-term solution to rely on). I've seen a therapist at school for a short period of time as well and had the same feelings, like I just felt like an alien/someone abnormal for thinking the way I do. Which I guess is kind of true since we're not exactly neurotypical but I feel like I just crave someone who can truly relate? I can't talk to my family since they tend to invalidate what I'm going through. 


Lurking on this subreddit community means a lot, but I sometimes feel like I would benefit from having a real-life friend who also experiences what I do and whom I can call/meet up when things get really bad -- especially someone who's culturally similar to me, and preferably someone I already know (I think I would find it so liberating to share how I feel with someone I already know). However, there are two issues with this:


1) I don't know anyone around me with BPD -- if there is someone with BPD in my life, they're keeping it hidden as well

2) I wonder what it's like being friends with someone with BPD, and whether it would actually be good for each other. I'm worried, since it's two highly emotional people coming together, would it be like when a tornado meets a volcano -- really volatile and dramatic all the time?


I do feel the desire to connect with someone with BPD in real-life to the point that I'm thinking of creating a simple mobile app (I'm an app developer and computer science student) that allows people to ""declare"" their BPD and see if anyone in their friend group (such as people in their FB friends list) has also ""declared"" theirs. I would feel so much safer only letting others who have BPD know I have BPD. It could also help you find people with BPD near your location (should they choose to share it), since that increases the likelihood that they understand your context/culture better. 


What do you all think? Would be grateful to hear your experiences with pwBPD-pwBPD real-life relationships, how you formed these relationships (if you found them to be a positive force in your life), as well as your thoughts on my idea.

"DAE feel like they can never maintain interest in anything for too long? I don’t know if this is a BPD thing or what. But throughout my whole life, I’ve been constantly switching what I’m interesting in/passionate about. I’ve switched college majors about 4 times now, and have to just stick it out at this point to graduate, but I don’t want to do anything related to my undergraduate degree and completely change courses for grad school.

Even growing up- I went from being intensely interested in one sport/activity to another, but never sticking with any of them. I was super passionate about musical theater for 2 years or so and ended up starting University as a music major, but now I literally want nothing to do with music anymore.

"I don’t know anyone who can relate to my symptoms and I feel so alone I have bpd?

It’s so strange for me to type that. It’s a relatively recent label for me and I’m still getting used to it. I don’t know anyone with it in my life(that I’m aware of) and I think I’m just lookin for someone who can say, “Yeah I experience that too. You’re not alone and I know your pain.”

At least with anxiety and depression, they’re (unfortunately) so widespread its somewhat easy to find someone who can say that. But with bpd, I feel like i’m kinda on an island. I came to this sub to find people I relate to, but it just seems that what I experience is radically different that what I’ve seen posted here and I still feel alone. I guess the point of this is to write out my experiences and hope someone can relate?

The most significant symptom I experience is the mood swings. I get incredibly intense, constantly shifting mood swings that cause what I describe as “mental and emotional whiplash.” I go through these swings several times a day at worst, always turning on a dime. I could be having a pretty okay day, then I realize i fucked up some assignment dates and I’m suddenly dunked in this sinking ice feeling that I’m a total fuckup and of course I did this to myself and my mood is bitter and nasty for a few hours.  Then something else happens and I’m just angry, so angry and everything and nothing and most of all myself. I’m so angry and all I can do is just mentally stew myself. At this point i take a nap and when I wake up it’s like everything reset and I’m back to neutral/feeling okay. This is all within less than 24 hours. And the next day it’s the same thing but the triggers and emotions are different, but if it’s not the void of depression it’s several intense emotions a day, where all I can think of is that emotion for the duration. I can’t do much of anything during the worst of the negative swings besides take a nap to try to reset my mood.

I’ve done a ton of personal research on mental disorders, they run in my family and I always seem to gravitate towards people also with mental illness(of varying types.) I know this extreme mood shit isn’t bipolar, since I don’t really get manic and all my reading/bipolar friend anecdotes describe episodes lasting multiple days or weeks. This isn’t just regular depression either, it’s like all my emotions get turned up to fucking 11 and put in a centrifuge.

CW: Self Harm

I get terrible compulsions to do bad things too, like eating way too much junk food just for the sake of tasting it(then hating and berating myself for my weight and inability to control my eating), cutting just for the feel of it(then being disgusted that I broke my clean streak, and wanting to hurt myself more as punishment), spending money just because “oooh shiny thing and i have a couple extra bucks!!” (and then wanting to kick my own ass for being so irresponsible, i mean really how can i be such a fucking idiot to buy lootboxes for a game i don’t even like that much anymore) I’ve even had multiple phases of risky and straight up unsafe sex practices, and I’ve been extremely fortunate none of it has fucked me over(so far).(I don’t get  any auto self-hate about sex though).

On my worst days, I truly hate who I am. I see absolutely nothing good or redeemable in myself, everything I’ve fucked up is all on me. I’ve been given chance after chance in life and I always manage to make sure I fail. I’ve read about splitting on people, and while I get intrusive thoughts that would fall into the category of splitting on the people i love(or just people i know) they’re usually very fleeting, but it seems to me I split on myself? Is that even a thing?? I almost think my prior therapy made this worse because i get stuck in these mental loops where I berate myself then try to shut that down by focusing on good things about me, but that gets shut down by more thoughts of how those good things are wrong and it just goes on and on and i just want to cry.

I have intense paranoia linked to many things, such as being abandoned by friends in the form of being passed up/forgotten! And I am constantly forgotten by people who are supposed to be my friends!! It happened all throughout my school life!! I just kinda expect to never get invited to things and that I always have to plan stuff and text people first. I’ve changed friend groups four times the past 5 or so years and nothing fucking changes! I’m convinced people are constantly talking about me or laughing about me when there’s no logical reason to think so, and then my thinking goes to “why the fuck would anyone even notice or want to talk about you anyways.”

I probably shouldn’t write anymore because writing about these thinking patterns tends to stir them up in my head. I just hope that I can find someone who experiences bpd closer to what I do.","The expanded size of the tensor (1175) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.

"I want to make sure I'm responding in the healthiest way(s) possible Throwaway account here.

My ex and I sort of reconnected and started something new, but given I had entered a polyamorous relationship in October - that is still my primary focus. It's been 7 weeks since we reconnected and she decided she's gotten too close to me and it hurts too much that my primary focus is on my primary partner rather than herself.

Polyamorous debates aside (given this is my first and only relationship of that type; it's something I'm experimenting with), I want to make sure I handle the spirals correctly in order to keep her the most safe as well as help her grow. 

I realize a lot of context will be missing in making this post, but I thought I'd post it to see what people thought based on their own experiences. She originally claimed to have BPD years ago, but in this phone conversation pre-text, I showed her a BPD article about FPs I thought she might relate to and that spiraled her into her thinking I was accusing her of being ""untouchable"" because of that diagnosis so I told her if she didn't want to define herself by it, I wouldn't either. But, that she could still fall on the spectrum and any knowledge should be useful to help her grow.

But - anyway, here's the convo:

"Choosing college as a BPD So, i mostly choose professions and interest around what i enjoy to do to ""zone out"" of world, being that computers, arts or similar stuff. I was good at everthing i had interest in untill i got bored and got another obsession, and those obsession seem to be centered around what my favorite people are like, so i don't really feel i own them.

I changed 5 collages in last 5 years and am planning to change it again this year so i don't get stuck on pretty much meaningless college i started i think because my ex was on it and i somehow associated it with feeling of security. And years before i chose collages mostly without thinking as i spent most of last years depressed. But want to do it for real this time.

How did you choose your college? How do you get sure the thing you are going on is ""the real one"", and not something that is either idealised, or mixature of someone's elses emotions you are empathically feeling (this happens alot). I want to live a normal life, have money and stuff, but i just can either see myself as good as everything, and usually can get good at everything but i eventually loose interest, or like i am never going to do anything i like and once i start doing something i feel like i went into the wrong direction and many important parts of me are going to die out because of this choice - and feel like it's not me. Also i live in country where there are many unemployed and the fact that i will not get a job if i finish most of the majors i consider fun is an another stressor.

I was on some stupid collage i never even wanted, then went on law school where i felt the best, but never studied as i had other preocupations with life, and i wanted to write and be a professor (professor part being obviously an idealisation). Then i went to some random technical college, later on art history that felt like shit and even tho it was interesting i could never see my life based around something i considered so ""secondary"" and like interesting trivia, and now i am on cultural studies that i don't feel like i deserve to call myself a student. And now i am thinking of either going back to law school, going into marketing or some tech studies. And it's fucking hard to choose what the fuck i really want as durring life i was interested and good at so many different stuff and left them all behind when i started feeling some emotional negativity with it.

Anyone had similar BPD problems? What did you do, and what college did you went on? What do you consider is ""what you truly want""?","The expanded size of the tensor (561) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.  Target sizes: [1, 561].  Tensor sizes: [1, 514]"

One of the replies on it was concise and said simply that narcissists seem to lurk here.

For anyone reading this subreddit, regardless of diagnosis or state of mind, something that **might** be common ground is the tendency to have had exposure as a child to people (likely adults) who were abusive/narcissistic/neglectful etc.

##For venting and off-topic, albeit relevant, discourse, can I suggest, /r/RaisedByNarcissists ?

It's quite bleak, but certainly seems to have room for the hopeless, the damning and the angry; of course those feelings have a place here, too, but when we need to rant it could be better shared away from a sub that aims for (from the sidebar) learning, and being kind, empathetic, respectful, and non-judgmental.

I realise that this post and anything that advocates vetting &amp; vetoing certain kinds of content is, literally, judgmental. I hope that there's enough nuanced difference that I'm not a glaring hypocrite right now...

"Let's discuss BDP and pets Hello guys,

I need your help on this.

My significant other was diagnosed with BPD (she has had eating disorder and depression for two years), and something I've been postponing for some time is the decision about pets. She loves dogs and somehow I think it would be a good thing for her since she's home all the time without much to do. She is capable of taking her of it. I mean, she wouldn't leave the dog at home and not go out never. 

I want to know what you think, if it's beneficial or not, and what I should know about it, from experience or not.

Let's start a discussion focused on positive things.



I.. I really do need help. I'm trying to be positive throughout the years, being understanding and looking for the right paths to take, taking care of everything and helping in whatever way I can. But on this subject, I want to be sure and hear other people's opinions. 

I hope you can share with me and others your experience with pets, and probably help me take a decision on this matter. 

Have a good week!

"Does anyone else have this problem? (Telling people about your BPD) Hi everyone,

I just came here to vent, to be honest, because I really don’t know what to say anymore and whether it is only me.

I was diagnosed with BPD a year ago, after years of struggling with my emotions, losing people, being unable to form relationships, suicide attempts, drug abuse etc, you probably understand. 

Slowly, I decided to open up to friends and family about this and, I kid you not, almost every person tells me something along the lines of “but aren’t we all borderline?” or “oh, but I also see the world in black and white, you’re ok” or “everybody has problems like that, that doesn’t mean you are borderline”, or “I am also sad but I just pick myself up, you should too” or “are you sure you aren’t exaggerating?” and it goes on and on. I feel like my issues are just pushed aside and no one takes me seriously, which makes me feel even more alone. 

Have any of you encountered this? What do you say to this? I feel as if I should keep this a secret so no one judges me, since they don’t seem to understand.

"Even when it’s good, it’s bad. I’ve been feeling pretty good lately, since the end of last year after I recovered from the biggest breakdown of my life.

I managed to hold a job for 9 months (3 months is usually my cut off point), and I’m wanting to get back into work since my last job was an internship so it came to an end recently.

I’ve gone from not being able to function to being pretty high functioning, motivated to get working and keep going. I’m not suicidal, I haven’t self harmed in months, I have a wonderful boyfriend and wonderful friends and I’m actually working towards a career and sticking to it.

Despite all of this, I’ve been depersonalising frequently and really badly. It’s as though when I’m feeling good, I don’t feel real because I’ve never felt good before. Ever.

I feel good but hollow, if that makes sense. Like I’m faking my way through life so I don’t self destruct. 

It’s like when I’m not horrifically depressed, when I’m not pushing people away or doing things that I know will end badly, I just feel empty. If I’m not in some sort of pain I don’t feel like myself. I don’t feel like I exist at all.

I almost self harmed the other day just because I felt like such a ghost, and I wanted to feel something because all I was feeling was nothing.

Is this what BPD does? If you’re not allowing it to destroy you then it just makes you feel like you’re non-existent, like you’re pretending to live. And if you do give in to it, you become this monster who hurts everyone around you in order to ultimately hurt yourself.

I’m just really tired of living with this stupid disorder. I hate living with it, I hate the stigma that surrounds it because I feel like if I mention it to people, they’re just going to hate me and think I’m an awful person. I hate that I don’t even know who I am, that I look back on my life and realise I haven’t got a clue who I am.

Ugh. Sorry this is so long but I’m really sick of being mentally ill and needed somewhere to vent.","The expanded size of the tensor (540) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.  Target sizes: [1, 540].  Tensor sizes: [1, 514]"
"Being drunk Even when i think I’m getting better (have a loving n supportive boyfriend, family and friends), there are still moments where I surprise myself by exhibiting BPD traits that I thought were in remission. Got home from drinks with friends, verrrrrryyyy drunk and dropped one of my earrings on the ground (one of the studs made of surgical implant grade materials that cost like $50 and can stay in your ears forever) and spend like an hour crawling on the ground trying to find it, which ended in me bawling my eyes out and screaming (I was home alone btw). 

Although logically I knew I was overreacting and that I’d be better off just waiting until the next morning to try and find it, I just crawled around the ground, crying n screaming trying to find this god damn earring. I got a glass out of the cupboard and smashed it on the bricks in the backyard, checked my Snapchat trying to distract myself and found my boyf had opened without replying  a bunch of my snaps saying I was really really drunk (like near SOS stage) and that kinda just cemented it for me. The fact that I was having a breakdown over a misplaced fucking earring just made me think how it was inevitable that he would leave me because of all the stupid intense shit I do bcos of BPD. Lucky I have a psychologist appointment tomorrow but idk if I can be fucked making it there cos I’m gonna be mega hungover and shameful tomorrow. I don’t even know why I’m posting this, I haven’t needed to post in this subreddit in months and months, but I’m just so scared of losing him that Idk what else to do. He doesn’t know about my BPD. 

For a little bit, I steered clear of alcohol for these reasons, but that’s not something I really want to do again, cos I have great times when I’m drunk as long as I’m with people and in the right mindset, but these breakdowns make me feel sick and just bring about the “psycho attention seeking bitch” phenotype I try so hard to avoid.

"Insomnia rant Guess I'm venting a bit. 

It's 7:30am, I can't sleep as usual. I have therapy later today and I don't want to go. Group therapy, one on one, plus the shrink. I always come home in tears. 

I haven't been at it long, it feels like my billionth try at therapy but my first try at DBT, I hate it. I hate talking in front of strangers, especially about my feelings. I didn't go last week because I dumped my boyfriend. He's better off without me but he refuses to believe it. I just hurt everyone around me, I'm a toxic cancer.

I cut myself again, I just want to die. I don't want to leave my house or my bed. I don't want to talk to people or see anyone. I've never posted on Reddit before but this seems like the spot to let my crazy flow a bit. No one understands how I feel or how my brain works, I feel like an abomination on Earth. This messed up head of mine is a mistake. I don't deserve to live. 

I just feel like trash.

"Sick of faking BPD and other disorders Recently fell out with a decent friend of mine on discord (we ran a server together), he was being super passive aggressive towards another friend of mine of mine and I couldn’t take it so I didn’t back anyone up I just stepped down as admin and stopped replying, my girlfriend also happened to be an admin there and this friend made the mistake of talking Down to her, if he was in person I would’ve broken his face but as it was over the internet I just decided fuck it ok not gonna help you and told him to delete the server and to have a good life and I hope he gets the treatment he clearly needs, that’s where the story should end. Over the last 2 days since his happened he has done nothing but abuse me and my friends and accuse me of being the worst person in his life. He has messaged me everywhere he can and I think he’s obsessing a bit which concerns me. I believed him when he said he suffers from BPD despite the fact that he seems to self diagnose everything before he goes to a doctor but the last couple of weeks me and others had noticed how he would discover a new “symptom” that people with bpd sometimes do and it would start happening to him a lot, the same can be said for multiple disorders. I just wanted to vent but I’m sure he will see this, feel free to tell your side of the story I would talk to you about it but you have me blocked and only in block me to message me.","[[{'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.22275112569332123}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.1446692794561386}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.14064782857894897}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.13103161752223969}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.12945160269737244}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.09167851507663727}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.05165930464863777}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.04056159779429436}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.035052474588155746}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.019122140482068062}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.01848800666630268}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.010444953106343746}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.009905113838613033}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.008586427196860313}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.007879464887082577}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.003683132352307439}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.003534698626026511}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.0030053257942199707}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.001948259538039565}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.0017728370148688555}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.001619985094293952}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.0015314376214519143}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.001316034933552146}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.0012874151580035686}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.0007909004925750196}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.0007422107155434787}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.0006237493944354355}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0004680640995502472}]]"
"Breakdown Stream of Consciousness Something I wrote when I was having a breakdown this afternoon.  I did a quick spellcheck to make sure it was at least intelligible, but I've left all the other errors as they were made.  I guess I just wanted to share.  Maybe someone can help, or a least just understand.

&gt; And even as my hands are furiously going and words are just spilling out it feels like my mind is just empty that there isn’t anything in there.  There's just this blank stare and i ' m not even looking at the screen.  I could just be crying or screaming.  I guess that’s what it's like inside is just screaming  there’s a little girl inside of me, sitting in the corner with the blanket pulled up over her head, rocking back and forth in the dark, within the walls would just get closer and closer.  Then there's just this other little girl the same little girl screaming as loud as she can into the sky.  She’s just screaming and screaming and shaking and crying and now she’s falling down because the world is just too exhausting.  She’s just staring there and all wide eyed and lonely.  She wants a hug but she knows she doesn’t deserve one so she’s just going to become the little girl in the corner, rocking back and forth, until another little girl comes along and screams.  There's a room of these little girls and they don’t know how to talk to one another.  They don’t see each other they just see the black walls and the little light that comes from underneath  The screaming girls aren’t trying to get their attention but not even screaming for help  just screaming.   Just screaming and devolving into the animalistic creatures there only capable of being.  There is no productivity.  There is no hope.  There is no skill.  There is no ability.  There is nothing.  Nothing but hell.  Nothing.

"Non BPD Wife Seeking Advice My husband has BPD. I've tried to be as understanding as I can. Supporting him to get the right kind of help. I've told him he needs someone he can vent to that he doesn't have an emotional connection with. His denial of what he's like when his switch is triggered is, I think, the hardest part of being on the outside of it. He can get mean...so...mean. He feels that since he doesn't hit me or call me terrible names that it's not mean. He is impossible when he is in that state. We even have a nickname for it. When he finally snaps out of it, he denies just how terrible it was. I've tried. I've tried so hard, but I'm getting completely worn down.

 I'm not giving up on him, but I'm starting to shut down. I know it's hard for him, but if he can't admit to a lot of it, or seek the proper help, what can I do? I always end up crushed, and trying to put my pieces back together after a switch. After 4 years, I don't know what to do. He is fantastic, and the love of my life, until he becomes that other person.

My spirit is breaking, and I don't know how much longer I can do this. That's why I'm here. What can I do, on my part, to make the episodes not so explosive? 

Someone commented on another post to not take things at face value during a switch. I feel this is a good place to start.

"Borderline's w/ No Acting Skills Get Me Heated I am @ a small art school and there is a dude with typical Borderline traits, I wanna like him.

But he doesn't shut the fuck up about how sad he is, how much validation he needs, his fears, sexual curiosity, etc. It's the most cringe worthy character I could ever imagine creating and brews a deep hatred I wish didn't exist. 

The anger derives from the fact that I know exactly where he is coming from and it freaks me out. So everyday; I put on this mask, act like a confident narcissist and sure as hell to don't degrade my masculinity. I get arrested, make people hate me, manipulate, and ruin everything I care about; but there's no fuckin reason to be a faggot about it! LOL

Maybe I'm taking this too personally, but I hate seeing my demon outside of the cage. Suppress that motherfucker and let it drown.

"Experiencing Extreme Emotions As per usual with BPD, but sort of at the point of apathy regarding them as well. Like before, I'd be sitting there and Guilt and Shame come busting down my door screaming ""TIME TO FEEL, BITCH"" and then proceed to terrorize me for however long. But now, I'm more like ""Oh hey guys, beers in the fridge, make yourselves at home"". The emotions still suck to have but I'm too exhausted trying to be pro-active in preventing them. I'm just becoming more and more depressed. My counselor just keeps telling me to be mindful and that these are things I have to tolerate, but what's the point of life if you just spend it tolerating your emotions rather than actually being happy. The only time I've ever felt stable and comfortable and didn't have horribly negative emotions was when I was single and didn't have a dog, so I gave my dog away and broke up with my girlfriend. It should be heartbreaking but I just feel so god damn numb and void inside now because I'm so tired. However, I now feel like I have the opportunity to focus on myself, becoming healthy again mentally and physically and moving forward with my goals instead of staying in this emotional purgatory. Having responsibilities to other living things, be it a pet or another human, is just far too overwhelming for me and I guess the point of this is for validation....I just want to know someone can relate.

"Is work even an option? I've been wondering this for years now, especially since I dropped out of school (FOA, I did graduate high school with a mixed bag of grades..) It's been almost three years now since then.

Any attempt to work, even part time, as in two times a week for seven hours a day, is absolutely futile. I end up having to quit or being fired for too many sick days. A leave I need because the stress is life ruining to me. I know that people should be able to cope with more, but I am utterly incapable of dealing with stress.. writing applications alone already devastates me and my energy is often gone before I can even start with one - now, work tends to turn me into a vegetable; I can't leave my bed, and if I'm forced to leave the house I immediately get the impulse to act on whatever suicidal fantasy is playing out in my mind at the moment.. the only thing preventing me from doing that is actually my struggle to move when I'm in that zombie-like state...

I've been unemployed for almost a year now. In spite of starting therapy and testing a variety of medication, things seem to be looking down. Even on good days, if I think about doing anything for my future, it usually ends in tears and me in a near catatonic state.. I feel pathetic like this, really, because I know I'm smart, just.. not capable of keeping up with what I'm expected to do - what would be normal for me to do.

Due to my ever deteriorating mental and, due to this, also physical health, I'm questioning if I should maybe give up? Not necessarily permanently, but maybe I should find a way to sustain myself that will be less.. damaging? I know that I have to move out of my parents' home, because they're incredibly abusive and I will only become worse in this environment (something that even my therapist often points out to me, she predicts that being near my parents is going to stunt any progress I could make), but I can't afford my own home since I'm unemployed.
    Is it possible to arrange something, somehow? I know that here in Germany, there's a way for unemployed individuals to get a certain amount of money from the state, under the condition that a certain amount of applications is sent per month, no matter where. But even with only that I'm not so sure if I could manage.. since I live with my parents still, all the child support money is going into their bank account, and I'm too afraid to ask them about that. So... is there any way to determine if I am unable to work due to my disorder(s), which will help me get financial aid while I have time to sort out my life without the stress that always makes me suicidal, and too mortified to take necessary actions? Or am I bound to be stuck with my abusive parents and a death wish for life?","The expanded size of the tensor (615) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.

"diagnosed w/ BPD (kind of) but missing key symptoms hey y'all,

i've been diagnosed w/ BPD twice (most recently in november when hospitalized) but my psychiatrist believes the diagnosis is wrong and that i have rapid cycling bipolar. while i am 100% convinced i have bipolar as well, i have a lot of the symptoms of BPD. 

however, i lack a few key symptoms. i have no history of/current chaotic interpersonal relationships. minus a few mania related mistakes, i actually have alarmingly normal interpersonal relationships and (when not manic) i'm supposedly excellent at conflict resolution when i do have issues. i've never even raised my voice in an argument. i've never had a favorite person or anything close and i have no real issues with abandonment. i also don't really have any issues with a chronic sense of emptiness, although i have felt it in the aftermath of a manic episode. 

i have other symptoms (emotional instability, self-harm, identity issues, substance abuse, etc) but my psychiatrist says that since i'm missing such key parts of the criteria he's hesitant to diagnose me with BPD and believes they're more related to a mixed episode since, although they're always present, they tend to escalate and recede episodically without any prompting aside from lack of sleep, stress, time of year, etc. and get better with medication. 

is it possible to have BPD and not have any of those symptoms at all? i'm not asking for a diagnosis (since i already have one), but just curious as to whether or not anyone else has any experience in this area.

"I'd like to suggest a fantastic book, though it may be triggering so use caution. The Buddha &amp; The Borderline

""In this memoir, Van Gelder documents her diagnosis, treatment and recovery from BPD. She begins the book when she’s 30 years old, when she’s already attempted several times to take her own life, gone through a handful of hospitalizations, been diagnosed with depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder and recovered from alcohol and drug addiction.""

It is a very in depth account of someones personal journey with BPD. It may be a tough read for many of you, but I think it can be worth it to see how someone can go through the hell of BPD and come out the other side.

"There has to be more to these intense emotions When I'm having an episode of intense negative emotions that I know is BPD acting up, I need to distract myself or try to promote a different headspace usually, but do you ever feel that it is devaluing those emotions? I believe that if I feel *this* strongly about something it has to be real and true, I mean... why else would I feel this deeply?

While I know it is the disorder, it doesn't feel like it since this is **my** 'normal' and always has been. I wonder all the time what the difference is between having BPD and not. I only know my reactions are often different compared to others, but I find myself wanting to know how different I actually am, and when I see the confused look on people's faces when I try to express myself, it appears to be quite a lot... or is it? 

It is hard to say when I feel so much I want to rip my chest open is *just* an illness, like I'm going through hell just because I'm dysfunctional. Sometimes it just happens so suddenly I don't even know what triggered me and I get lost in my own chaos trying to figure out what is resonating with me so deeply and *why*. Why do I feel like I'm burning alive? What is my brain trying to tell me? Why does it hurt this badly? Although digging often makes it worse, so it is that or trying to redirect when seems... invalidity. Even with some DBT skills, in the end, it is dampening a firestorm into a flame of a lit candle, but it is to act like that firestorm never existed even though when it happens, it feels so critical, at times life or death, until the storm passes. Honestly, the same goes for positive emotions. When we are so completely happy, totally elated, we aren't being told to get rid of those. How are those accepted and welcome, but we are to dismiss the opposite? 

We can feel things others cannot in a way... and I'm aware it is a curse but can be a (at times, lonely) gift in some ways. I want to believe that when I feel **so** profoundly, it is ME and it is true... not this horrible illness. That all this intensity is for something more than some 'malfunction' in my personality. That I'm not going through these surreal highs and lows for nothing. There is something that speaks to my humanity within all the turmoil.

I know I'm only supposed to feel a little bit of this intensity to be considered healthy, but that *doesn't even sound right at this point*. I don't want to go through the pain, but it makes me think if I was cured, I fear I'd feel soulless without such depths.

"Two weeks going on three. I’m tired of hearing “things will get better” I’ve had a falling out with life. There’s no surprise there. These past two weeks have been hell. I can’t seem to get myself out of it. I haven’t felt this way since last year(before I went on meds) and it won’t stop. I wake up every day and life just doesn’t seem worth it anymore. Everything I’ve been through has become pointless. Everything I do has become pointless. 

I feel like I try so hard just for my life to be shit. I don’t think I remember a time that I was actually happy. I grew up being abused or watching people get abused. I’ve been sexually assaulted and have no one believe me(my ex boyfriend told me it was my fault because I was a whore). All of the shit that happens in our lives is supposed to make us stronger. Who the fuck came up with that? Does anyone ever get over being abused? Personally, I’ve just shoved it away and forgot about it. I’m past it but I have never gotten over it. I’ve tried to forgive the people who hurt me but I feel deep down that I still fucking hate them for what they’ve done. 

Also, while it’s still on my mind, I can’t remember fucking shit from my childhood. I can only remember the bad shit(being abused or watching the abuse) and I can’t seem to figure out why. The memories that I have of my childhood felt like dreams. Like it never really happened. The last bits of my memories stopped when I’ve waken up from sleep.(sorry, it’s hard to explain)Has anyone else ever experienced that?

"How does your diagnosis help you? My whole life has been an emotional rollercoaster. Going up, and down, up and down. I've always known something was off. As a child, I had severe anger issues. And I reacted overjoyed or extremely sad/angry. 

For the first time in my life I've actually set through with getting help. The psychologist I saw a few months back thought I showed some heavy signs towards BPD (extreme fear of abandonment, suicidal thoughts and self harm, just to name a few). 

Next Monday I will finally see a specialist in personality disorders. Who is going to help me figure out what is going on inside that wonderful brain of mine? And what we can do about it.

With hesitation, I told my mother. I knew how she was going to react. She told me there is nothing wrong with me. That I should just learn how to behave and that these tests are just to get money out of me. She doesn't know everything. She doesn't know I self-harm and have suicidal thoughts because the one time I told her she told me I should stop trying to get attention. 

Now I am in doubt, I don't want to lie and hurt my mother's feelings by getting tested. But I also want to know what's going on with me. I am very well aware that I show some clear signs, and that a diagnosis can help me get back on track.

"New psychiatrist thinks I might have autism (maybe instead of bpd). Freaking out My current, and amazing, therapist referred me to a new and more intensive program, especially for borderline. The psychiatrist who leads the program has years of experience working with kids with autism and she now questions if I actually have autism and that, to cope with it all, I behave in a bpd like way. I'm so confused and it's really messing with me. I have had my bpd diagnosis for a couple of years now, my childhood was a perfect environment to develop such a disorder so it makes sense, I tick every box of the DSM, my current therapist sees me as almost textbook bpd and I feel so at home and understood in a community like this. I relate so much to you all. 

But therapy (10+ years and different kinds of it) doesn't seem to really work. My therapist understands me, validates me, helps me. She really is great, I thought I understood things better but life is still the same and messed up. I can't seem to apply anything? I'm not able to process anything that happened in the past and stuff that keeps happening, it just keeps piling up. I'm not able to give anyone or myself a clean slate. This causes severe emotional pain and I've felt burned out for the longest, but it also makes relationships or human interaction very difficult. The new shrink says this is very typical for (women with) autism. So I relate to this and also other things that are, apparently, autistic and that other bpds didn't seem to have trouble with and have caused therapy to not be so fruitful. But troubles like not understanding emotions or other people, low empathy, etc are not me at all. It may be a case of having bpd comorbid with autism but, as I said, the shrink thinks it's probably that I've developed bpd as a coping method.

I don't want to lose my bpd and I don't understand myself at all now so I'm really spiraling. I know how bpd is heavily stigmatized but I have kind of a personal stigma towards autism. Those who have this diagnosis are the people that have always triggered me the most, being the case that they are typically not very caring, empathetic or understanding. I don't feel like I belong in this group but moreover, I don't want to. My loved ones don't understand why this situation is causing me such panic and pain.

"My friends are a-holes. In my friendships I've always been loyal, understanding, giving. I can keep a secret to the grave. But I've never had a friend like this? I'm 24, I see people's posts on social media, they're drinking and chatting with old friends. I know I'll never have that. My oldest best friend cut me off cause her boyfriend told her to. The next one tried to copy my identity and disrespected me so many times. The next one tried to steal money from me ( it was also a business partnership), the next one went behind my back with my ex. So now I'm sitting here unable to make friends with actually nice people because I'm afraid of being hurt and I can't trust anyone, and can't reconnect with my old friends because I don't want toxic people in my life. 

And right now I have like 3 friends. And all of them are still in my life because we have a 10 year history. Thats all. I feel like I'm changing and adapting and they can't. They're still students, I'm working. They don't respect me, they don't take me seriously when I say "" hey guys, let me know when you have a plan so I can arrange myself.""

I shifted all my appointments (I'm a tattoo artist)  to today even though it would be bad for my back. Cleared the whole day and just sat and waited. Then I got a text at 4 pm.

"I just found out my FWB has BPD and she startet to love me. Now I'm living with my ex and she and I want to get back together again. How the fuck am I supposed to deal with that? I'm scared. I realy like my FWB, I dont know her for too long but she told me a few days ago that she has BPD and is going to therapy, taking medication etc.

Now the situation is that my ex and I are still living together. And we somehow managed to rekindle our relationship. I don't want to hurt my FWB, but I have to break up the ""friends with benefits"" thing. But I think, that she thought we could get together and I think she loves me.

Now how do I deal with that.
I'm meeting her today, I definitely want to do that in person (or is that not a good idea?)

The problem is she just had an episode of extreme self worthlessness? I have no idea how to call it. And she is still a bit in that episode.

I guess my question is. Is it better for her to break up with her while she still has an episode anyway? Or should I wait a few days?

"The worst thing about BPD Sorry for the terrible formatting, posting from mobile

"Best Resource for Finding Treatment/Psychologists? Ever since I’ve been diagnosed I’ve had a turbulent consistency of clinical help. Haven’t ever been with a therapist that I felt connected to or truly trusted to help me. I had no problem getting along with them or asking advice but I feel they never knew the depth of me to be able to call me out or get intimate about things I might be avoiding. None of them were specialized in personality disorders/trained for DBT and had been assigned to me post discharge. 
I’m tired of settling for care and would like to find someone who would do a really great job with a Borderline patient but I’m having difficulty finding resources to search for that. I live in New York City so I really didn’t think that it would be too hard here but hardly any clinicians that specialize in working with patients with Borderline and DBT treatment accept insurance let alone mine (I have United).

"BPD ""relapses"" Sometimes I see people on here talking about how they thought they were in ""remission"" and then they ""relapsed.""  They speak of how they thought they were recovering because the duration between ""relapses"" was longer than before.

But the length of time between BPD ""relapses"" is not an automatic sign of recovery. That's because the duration of time between episodes could be attributable to trigger avoidance.  Like, if a person goes for a year without an episode, but for that year she was single when normally she's in a relationship.  Or if a person goes for six months without an episode, but during that time he was away from his family.  These are cases of trigger avoidance - whether deliberately or by chance.  It is to be expected that episodes will occur less frequently or not at all when the triggering stimuli is not present.

Duration of time between relapses is not the primary indication of recovery; severity of episodes is a better measure. Ideally over time, episodes should be less emotionally charged, less intensely negative, and less resultant in harmful behavior.  That is a better measure of recovery than time duration between episodes.

"Help with Adulting So in the past few years I’ve been slowly giving myself more “adult” responsibilities, stuff like living with my partner and doing the cleaning and having the bills come out of my account. That kind of thing. 
However it’s gotten to the point now where I think I’ve taken on far too much. I’m constantly stressed and anxious and I feel sick. It’s making me so depressed as well and I’m getting angry with my partner over the littlest things. In short I feel like I’ve taken on too much too quickly and it’s making my bpd worse. 

I was just wondering if anyone has any useful tips for “adulting” with bpd to relieve some of the anxieties of all this. The pressure and everything is getting to me so much I’m considering ways out and it’s just too much to handle. 

I talk to my partner about it often but I don’t think he understands. We share the chores and such but he works way longer hours than me and can’t do anymore than he does. I’m not sure how to get anymore help with this. And it’s making me feel like a child that can’t look after themselves properly. Which of course, in turn is making me feel worse about the whole situation. 

If anyone has any advice that would be greatly appreciated ","[[{'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.26850488781929016}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.21787990629673004}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.19513438642024994}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.15935225784778595}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.12912635505199432}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.10352218151092529}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.03893609717488289}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.03396358713507652}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.0279874075204134}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.02440257929265499}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.02045266143977642}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.018284818157553673}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.0167898740619421}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.015056242235004902}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.013170729391276836}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.009834280237555504}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.009170693345367908}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.008488035760819912}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.007437026593834162}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.007388773839920759}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.0061104497872292995}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.005679117515683174}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.004557151813060045}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.004427360370755196}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.004209787119179964}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.0015762991970404983}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.0009588786051608622}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.0008497037924826145}]]"

I don't have that kind of money :( she suggested I try to find some self help books till I can find someone new. But she didn't give specific recs so here I am.

"I don't know what to do About two weeks ago I had the worst days of my life. I had to block my best friend because of the way I treated her. It's my fault, I caused all of this but I didn't want to.  
I was aggressive at first because I felt like she was getting distant and she doesn't care about me anymore. Logically thinking I know it's probably not true, shes just dealing with a lot of stuff lately, and has a boyfriend now so she can't spend as much time with me, which hurts.

Usually I'm not aggressive and I just get very sad and depressed when I feel like she hates me or something, this is actually the first time I lashed out on her, and I feel terrible. We used to tell each other everything, spend basically all of our free time together, which was good. And even though no day passed without me questioning whether she hates me, overall I was happy because we did everything together so every time I was soon proven wrong, and realized she is happy to have me as her friend.  
But lately shes been spending more and more time with her boyfriend, and less with me, plus as I said she's dealing with a lot of stuff too, so these things combined set off a part of me I didn't even realize I had.

At first I was angry and aggressive, and blamed everything on her, I told her I don't understand why she hates me, and why would she abandon her best friend like this. Since this was the first time I reacted aggressively, she thought I had a problem with her and refused to talk to me afterwards. Then I started to panic and frantically apologized for everything I said and done, I became disgustingly manipulative and I hate myself for it.  
She accepted my apology, but within two days the same thing happened, I felt like I don't matter to her anymore, I became very angry, etc. But after that I felt like apologizing again is not a good idea and from now on being aggressive and apologizing would just alternate daily, and I can't do that to her. I had no idea what to do.. I told her I don't want to hurt her feelings, what I did was unforgivable and I don't want this to happen ever again, that it's none of her fault and I still love her, but I need a little time to get my shit together, and I blocked her because it's better for her this way.

A little more than 2 weeks has passed. The first days were terrible, but I gradually started feeling better. I still have hours when I feel like everything is lost. Not as often and not for that long though.  
But I'm starting to really miss her, I want my friend back, I want to contact her but I don't trust myself. Right now I feel like I could control myself, stay calm whatever happens. But I really don't want to act the way I did and hurt her again. I feel like this is my last chance to correct things, and if I fuck up again she will no longer want me as her friend.

So yeah, I don't know.. Should I unblock her and talk to her, or should I wait?","The expanded size of the tensor (680) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.  Target sizes: [1, 680].  Tensor sizes: [1, 514]"

I don't even know whether I qualify to get a diagnosis or not but I just want to know what's wrong with me (or maybe I just need to be told that I am ""normal"" and that I'm just overreacting). 

ADD: Just to clear things up, It's not that I feel like I have or should have BPD which is why I want to get diagnosed but because I might have something else entirely or even nothing at all.","[[{'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.6449120044708252}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.2313719391822815}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.19696876406669617}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.08301568776369095}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.07731825113296509}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.07511862367391586}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.04728051275014877}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.04025346040725708}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.04024498909711838}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.03564662113785744}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.0235267486423254}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.020388171076774597}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.014097744598984718}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.01227855496108532}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.0121043361723423}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.010463614016771317}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.009886709973216057}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.005480517167598009}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.005387367680668831}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.005207680631428957}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.003958601970225573}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.003740304848179221}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.0034196018241345882}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.002558886306360364}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.0024166807997971773}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.0015098742442205548}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.001350028207525611}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.0006225656834430993}]]"
"Just small needed advice I hope you don’t think I’m asking for a diagnosis, because I know only a professional can do that I just want to know how you ended up with your diagnosis or what’s your story? 

Here’s a little background: I’m super Hispanic and come from an all Hispanic family as well. When I moved to college I realized something was wrong but I just thought I was going through a small funk. Well long story short I ended up in the ER because of a panic attack, I had no idea what those were until then. I was forced to get on medicine and see a therapist, and I’m happy that I did. It’s been a long journey and I started seeing myself get better, but it’s almost been a year now and I have these crazy bad days. I chalk it up to depression, but I’m either have good days or bad days. 

And long story short I realized that I had been experiencing a lot of the symptoms of quiet bpd. I found it out when I was trying to see if I had bipolar because of these random spouts of irritability  and crying but it just didn’t really resonate with me. And even though it’s kind of scary I brought it up to my therapist and he brushed it off TWICE. I mean if he doesn’t think I have it, that’s fine but he didn’t really answer no either. I’m confused because it’s not like I want a label, I just want to know if there is something more wrong with me so I can make sure I’m treating it well so I don’t have these randomly horrible days where all I can do is cry and miss class and life in general. I have been treating anxiety for a year now and I still feel stuck, shouldn’t I be getting better by now?

I realize many of you are dealing with this personally, so I apologize for any of my ignorance, but I just want to know how you got your diagnosis. How did you bring it up? And to who? 

Thank you ","[[{'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.4311610460281372}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.41370880603790283}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.14787589013576508}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.11786407977342606}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.11643793433904648}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.09695650637149811}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.083218514919281}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.06984955817461014}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.05035470426082611}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.03639283403754234}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.03074715845286846}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.029276611283421516}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.027682634070515633}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.026997676119208336}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.023826327174901962}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.02289051190018654}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.014219304546713829}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.013930601999163628}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.012428841553628445}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.011135158129036427}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.010837514884769917}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.009635007940232754}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.0076117850840091705}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.007334770634770393}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.005247882101684809}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.0036326025146991014}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.0026396424509584904}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.0023064371198415756}]]"
"New Job Worries Hi there, needing some advice! I’ve been offered a new job which is actually amazing with great money/benefits.

"After a social media detox, I've decided to deactivate this Reddit account Disappearing off Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Steam etc. For a short period has helped me tremendously. I decided to give this ago after reading a few articles on depression, anxiety and low self-esteem being linked to social media through psychological research.

There were also younger adults and teenagers who reported that, before the findings, they left social media of their own accord and found that they were much happier with themselves, their lives and their friendships.

It might sound crazy, as disappearing off social sites would you make you more lonely, surely. I thought it was weird. But I decided to give it a try because fuck it why not? 

These were the things I noticed within my time away 

1 - I felt less lonely being alone. I came to really enjoy my own company, my own thoughts, whether good or bad. I was able to prioritise my time better and actually enjoy reading or watching t.v. without having to make a status about it and counting to see if anybody liked or commented on my posts.

2 - I had more exciting things to talk about at work and with friends. There was no more 'Did you see my post on Facebook?'. I actually had lots of things to talk about to my friends. And vice versa. Because I hadn't saw any of their statuses, it ment I could really pay attention to so much more. I could read visual and vocal cues better than if I just read it online. It ment we could talk for hours, and can still talk for hours, without the conversation stopping because we already read it on facebook. 

3 - that feeling of rejection when my partner or family member not liking my status has pretty much disappeared. There's nothing to compare my relationships to either. Why can't my girlfriend like my pictures like this person's partner can like there's etc. Why can't my relationship be like that etc.

4 - I don't really care how people see me anymore. I care about how I see myself more than what other people see. I want to be happy. Stable. Relaxed and spent time by myself when I finish work or college. Spending my day surrounded by people is exhausting, As much as I do like people's company, I've come to really appreciate being on my own and it makes me look forward to seeing everyone even more.

5 - my priorities have changed for the better. I don't get upset over losing contact with someone and seeing them living a happy life without me in it. If anything, I'm just as happy where I am in life as where they are, my time spending hours scrolling has gone. I'm way more productive now.

6 - I don't need to prove anything. I think this is the most important thing. Social sites, whether it be facebook or reddit, is essentially shouting in a room hoping somebody replies. If nobody replies, we get sad. If 1 person replies, We get happy. But then it gets addictive. We want that front page. We want that karma. We want to make our mark somewhere so we can say we've achieved something on this or that site. But what does it matter in 5 years time? I look at posts on my old account or Facebook from 5 years ago and I just get sad. I spent so much of my time and priorities on all the wrong things instead of spending it with the people I care about and who are here and real right in front of me.

This is a big message and it's somewhat hypocritical of me to write this and leave my account open for another week but genuinely I just want to know some honest opinions on anybody else that has done the same.

I won't be 100% leaving reddit, I'll just be changing the way I use it. For either my hobbies, like art or gaming, or for my programming work. I've abused this account for validation seeking purposes and now I want to use the site properly. 

If you've been thinking about leaving sites temporarily for a while, give it a go and see how you feel, you maybe surprised just how quickly you start loving your free time. It's not easy, it's hard and scary at first but trust me it gets better!","The expanded size of the tensor (891) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.

"Feel like my FPs best friend is becoming my new FP. I'm trying to cut off my old FP. I am so helplessly in love with her and she's only interested in me as a friend. This dissonance tore our relationship apart. She's off having a good time with her new partner and I'm stuck trying to get over her.

"My Psychiatrist Only ""Screened"" Me For Depression? Hi. I am NOT looking for a diagnosis from you guys. I hope this post is okay, if it belongs somewhere else let me know. A few days ago I FINALLY went to a psychiatrist (after years of knowing I should but putting it off). However, while there, she only ""screened"" me (checked me? IDK) for depression. Like, 100% of her questions were around depression. Unsurprisingly, I was diagnosed with major depression (with signs of anxiety).

But... she never once talked about splitting/depersonalization/dissociation/etc. and since her questions were so specific I couldn't really throw them in.

So what should I do? I am going back in 2 weeks to check up (she gave me a prescription to antidepressants). Should I just let her treat my depression and hope that will reduce my other symptoms? Should I ask her to screen me for BPD? Does it even really matter in the long run if I have the official diagnosis or not?

I'm just all over the place right now. (PS- not that it matters to you guys, or heck maybe it does, but one of the reasons I went to the psychiatrist was I took about 10 of those silly online quizzes about BPD and all of them said to go see a doctor about it... so I was trying to... but I was too nervous in the moment to say anything I guess).","[[{'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.3831554651260376}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.3183448612689972}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.22782939672470093}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.1004452258348465}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.08745106309652328}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.07264377176761627}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.07203488796949387}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.0648471787571907}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.052570946514606476}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.05085393413901329}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.04132059961557388}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.02969340980052948}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.02017061784863472}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.01905374601483345}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.017676925286650658}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.01588311232626438}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.014871353283524513}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.014275060966610909}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.011922535486519337}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.005795213859528303}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.005041514057666063}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.004915867932140827}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.003505759872496128}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.0033025823067873716}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.0022939981427043676}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.00138284417334944}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.001322072697803378}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.0009192115976475179}]]"
"Why is my BPD friend always trying to make me jealous? There's a guy I'm friends with who has Borderline. Things haven't always been entirely platonic between us but for some reason a relationship has never happened. Things are just never stable between us and we can't seem to have a normal day together without someone getting upset or angry (mainly him).

One thing that's really starting to bug me is how he constantly tries to make me jealous by lying about the attention he gets from other girls. Recently he'd been so distant from me. Like, I hadn't heard anything from him for weeks and I was starting to think he had no interest in me at all. So I ended up calling him and asking how he'd been. He told me he'd just been busy, and then started talking about this girl he'd been hanging out with. He told me how she'd been ""all over him"" and she'd left her ex-boyfriend to be with him. When I asked what happened between them, he replied ""nothing, she's not my type"". I didn't show any kind of reaction. 

Then later on I found out this girl was still with her boyfriend and she'd been away for the last two weeks, so they couldn't have been hanging out. So he's been lying to me to make me jealous, but I really don't understand why. He hasn't been in touch for weeks and I'm the one who is asking after him, yet he is trying to get some kind of reaction out of me. What for? It reminds me of times in the past where he'd constantly be bragging about how many girls he'd been speaking with on Tinder in front of me. Later on he admitted he said it all to make me jealous because he had feelings for me. But I don't buy that excuse anymore. If he genuinely liked me, he'd have just asked me out by now surely?

The last time I spoke with him, he called me up asking if he could come over. He said he was really excited to see me and had this whole day planned. He had a list of movies he wanted us to watch together. He even hinted at wanting to stay over in my bed and he kept saying how happy he was to have him in his life. When he came round everything started off fine, but then I got this email from a job I'd applied for and really wanted. It was a rejection email and I was visibly upset. He seemed to be annoyed at me for being upset because the day was no longer revolving around his plans. Eventually he told me he wanted to go home and I pleaded with him to stay, saying I could really do with his support but he didn't want to. I even said he could stay over but he didn't seem interested anymore.

So now I'm left feeling really rejected and humiliated. I don't understand why he wastes energy making me jealous and planning dates with me, yet the moment I show any sort of emotional vulnerability or affection he's no longer interested? Does he even like me?","The expanded size of the tensor (635) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.  Target sizes: [1, 635].  Tensor sizes: [1, 514]"
"Looking for tips on how to deal with chronic feelings of emptiness. In the 15 years since I received my diagnosis I've worked really hard in and out of therapy to alleviate the majority of my BPD symptoms, but there are few things that DBT/CBT just doesn't seem to fix for me. 

I still struggle on a daily basis with recurring bouts of emptiness, usually brought on my overwhelming feelings of guilt and shame for things that I've done in the past. 

Does anyone have any coping strategies that they can suggest to combat these kinds of feelings? I would great appreciate your help!

"Boyfriend told me im not capable of love Too long to read:
Bf gave me permission to sleep with ""Mark"" and tell him about it. I did. Boyfriend got mad and hurt when I told him my PTSD was not triggered by ""Mark"". Bf said that because of my BPD I was incapable of loving him and never actually had. I just might have thought I had.

My off and on again boyfriend just dumped me after 2.5 years of going back and fourth. I've been wondering for a while if I have  undiagnosed learning disability. He know about this and had been supportive and wanted me to get tested so I could get help. Anyway, it all started where he gave me permission to sleep with my besties super hot roommate. Let call him ""Mark"". My bf said that so long as I used a condom and told him all about it and always asked him first I was fine to sleep with ""Mark"" So I did.

It was amazing. ""Mark""  was great, AND he didn't trigger my PTSD which Almost never happens. I was pretty happy with how things worked out and I was excited to share it with my boyfriend. My bf was happy to hear about it until I mentioned how my PTSD wasn't triggered (something my bf and I struggle with sexually). 

This is when my boyfriend got upset. He told me that I definitely don't have a learning disability. But he brought up the fact that he does. He talked about all the ways I couldn't possibly have a learning disability. Then he went on to say something his mom told him growing up (he on the spectrum) she told him he was incapable of loving anyone. Well me boyfriend told me that I was incapable of loving humans. He said I only thought I did and it would never be good enough the way I show love. He said I never loved him in the past and I never will and he can't believe me when I tell him I do, to the point where he told me not to tell him that anymore.

Then he kept trying to convince me to breakup with him and date ""Mark"". He kept saying all these reasons why I should break up with him then, without giving me any processing time (I need a lot), he would repeatedly jump in and ask me if I wanted to break up with him and or start dating ""Mark"". 

Then he told me to leave the apartment at 7:30 for my 9:00am appointment and told me to go over to my friend and ""Mark""'s house afterwards cuz he doesn't want to see me. 

I feel like shit. Idk what to do. He used to be very abusive and manipulative towards me and also called me abusive and manipulative. I thought this time he had actually changed. But this is all coming up again. In the past he said that because of my PTSD symptoms it meant I didn't love him. It just makes me hate myself. I feel like shit. I tried to kill myself like a week ago and he's still holding that as leverage.

We live together and that makes things harder. I'm not working because of my ""disabilities"" which idk, maybe I'm not actually disabled. Maybe I'm just a fucking lazy narcissist.

I guess I just needed to rant. And maybe know if any of you have been through anything similar? Is it true that some/many people with BPD are incapable of fully loving another human?","The expanded size of the tensor (730) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.

"My BPD Girlfriend Hi guys,

My girlfriend[26] of one year, who has BPD, broke up with me a few weeks back. She sprung it on me completely out of the blue, and gave me reasons that I know aren't true. Just a few days before everything was great, but she started a new job and became very stressed. She was very cold about the whole thing and didn't seem to care much about the fact she was breaking up with me. I mean, she even laughed and joked while she was doing it. I believe this is what you guys refer to as splitting? She wanted to remain friends but so far all my casual communications have been met with a passive aggressive tone. I haven't been begging, and haven't even mentioned the breakup.

Anyway, I am going to her house tonight to leave off her things that were still in my apartment. She won't be there, but her parents will be. I had planned to leave her a dozen rainbow roses for valentines. My question is, should I leave a note? I have so much I want to say, like I'll always love her and want to be there for her, but I feel this might be too heavy for her right now.

"Afraid of switching medications Hi all,
I know this topic gets mentioned a lot, but I was looking for some support/experiences. 

I’ve been on Prozac 80mgs daily for about two years now. It was the first medication I was prescribed, even before I was officially diagnosed with BPD. It has definitely helped my overall mood, but now my psychiatrist wants to stop the Prozac and start something new (specifically Abilify). 

My anxiety has been out of control in the last few months, and she believes the Prozac may have something to do with that. I also take Buspar 30mgs twice a day, which is great, but if I don’t take it my anxiety is almost crippling. 

Does anyone have any experiences with Abilify, or any other antidepressants that have worked for them? I’m sincerely afraid to stop the Prozac because of how bad things were before I started taking it. I know I’m probably being a baby here, but any advice would be greatly appreciated. 

Edit: I felt I should mention the meds I’m already on for reference.

Buspar 30mg twice a day

"Emotional Impermanence Coping Strategies So I came across something in a BPD chat group that sounds a LOT like something I struggle with, a phenomenon common among borderlines called emotional impermanence. The concept  is similar to object permanence, or knowing that a person or thing still exists when it is no longer in sight. Likewise, most people know that someone still feels something regardless of whether or not it’s being displayed right at that moment. 

I swear I probably tell my fiancé “I love you” , like 50 times a day. I am super affectionate, always wanting to show exactly what I’m feeling, especially if it’s something good, like warm fuzziness 😁

Not everybody needs that constant reminding though, and I forget that sometimes. And to someone who doesn’t know about/understand BPD, it can come off as a little insecure/obnoxious/stifling and I don’t necessarily blame them. 

I have considered having my fiancé and my girlfriend (yes, we’re poly) each record a nice message for me so I can watch/listen to it when I feel needy completely out of the fucking blue, as I tend to do. It could also help when my brain is being mean to me and telling me stupid, completely and utterly baseless shit like “they’re just humoring you” and “you’re going to die alone, who could ever stand to be around you?” ... and all sorts fun things like that 😂. 

Does anyone else struggle with this, especially in regards to your significant other/FP? 

I was recently diagnosed with BPD and the more I read about all this the more it makes soooo much sense. I want to improve my life and relationships so badly now that I have a road map. I’ve already made huge strides, it really important for me to improve in this too. 

Thanks for any advice/stories that show that others can relate 😁

"In or out of love So yes I'm an idiot.

I fell in love with this amazing girl.
The only problem is that well. She has borderline amd I think I am her fp. Or at least was.
We never truly had any relationship though we do loved each other. And yes I say loved.

She would fall in love with someone else while breakung my heart. Love that person for a few months, breack up and than love me again.

Repeat the previous paragraph times 6 and you have me.

Only now. It's different she doesn't love me anymore. While I am still madly in love.
.the sadness of her not poving me as I love her is so bad that she doesn't starts disliking me more of my sadness.

Yet I'm still following her like a dog hoping this new boyfriend of hers breakes up so she would start loving me again.

I can't belive I love someone so madly while she is constantly breaking my heart with a hammer. And yet she is everything I need

"Tentative diagnosis of BPD and wondering where to go from here- How to cope? I had a meeting with the school psychiatrist and she suggested that I might potentially have BPD. She said I have a lot of borderline traits and am quite narcissistic. I never considered BPD before. I originally thought I was just depressed. My family doctor prescribed zoloft, and it pushed me into a hypomania complete with hallucinations. Doctor took me off and started me on low dose seroquel to help me sleep again, and because she suspected I could be bipolar. Pdoc said to keep taking the seroquel in case of an underlying mood disorder since I tolerate it, but that there is not enough longitudinal evidence to suggest anything but BPD right now. 

She basically told me all the shitty things about myself, and said I probably just am overestimating myself and can't accept failure, because I feel like I'm struggling in school even though I know I am objectively fine. She pointed out my emotional volatility and unstable relationships. Suggested I quit drinking and using other drugs because they compound the problem and that I work on improving my self esteem. It was a lot of information, and I honestly now feel a lot worse about myself and like I have done this to myself. I don't even know how to begin to live with something like this. Looking for some experiences from others since I don't know anyone with BPD and it seems like it is poorly understood by most people so I don't feel like talking with my friends or family much. How can I begin to cope with this? The doctor didn't give me anything to get me through until I can get in to see a psychologist. I would appreciate hearing about any coping mechanisms that help other people, since I feel like I have nothing to go on.","[[{'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.4723457992076874}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.24659083783626556}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.14490251243114471}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.11011579632759094}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.10935661941766739}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.06119358167052269}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.05754624307155609}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.04562709853053093}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.04424722120165825}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.03264893218874931}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.016125040128827095}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.014532649889588356}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.014130562543869019}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.01241467334330082}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.012011186219751835}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.00935103464871645}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.00813787616789341}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.006175559014081955}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.005343108903616667}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.005229461472481489}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.00475048553198576}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.0042675696313381195}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.003569419961422682}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.0034211266320198774}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.002936889184638858}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.0012031982187181711}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.0009359300602227449}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.0005170841468498111}]]"

I'm here so family isn't great, in fact they overtly continue to hurt and exclude me from family events even knowing I'm in the worst depression of my life. It occurs to me.

"I tried going back to therapy but was pretty much told to leave. But should I try again? 2 years ago I was able to afford health insurance again and I needed to start seeing a therapist again and when I went I was just bombarded with, “why did you come in today?” “Why do you think you need help?” But before that he read my file and told me he knew immediately I had BPD. Everything I said was wrong and he ended the session with a 40 minute lecture on why I shouldn’t waste a psychologist times with this again. 

I still suffer from BPD, on top of agoraphobia that I’ve had since I was a child, and a eating disorder that is slightly under control. But I never leave the house without an escort (usually my dad or boyfriend sometimes my sisters). I still lash out and attack them unprovoked, I still dip low and have days where I don’t leave my bed and days where I can’t even explain my situation anymore, it’s so hard to voice this and not expect backlash. 
The reason my mind has been changed is because I watched a video on BPD on YouTube and in the comments a lot of people came forward to voice the stigmas their illness has brought them and apparently Doctors are just awful at dealing with BPD. A lot of people have been told the exact same thing as me and just had to go out and try again and meet a new doctor in hopes they will help. 

I’m moving again and will have the opportunity to meet a new doctor but should I? Or should I just continue with how things are? I feel like a burden to my loved ones but sometimes I don’t want to get better, I’m terrified Of change. And will i just rejected again? I don’t know if I could handle that..

"dependent on my mother just been diagnosed with bpd (the quiet type) a few weeks ago and it all makes sense now. i'm 20 yo now and growing up i didn't have many friends (basically one) so my mother, who i was very close to my mother, who is only nineteen years older than me. in just a few years, a lot of bad things happened to us. she broke up with my father, her dad (my grandpa) died and the rest of our family abandoned us. by the time i was 17, moving cities and starting college, she was diagnosed with depression, and i was the only one who could take care of her, so i completely dissociated from my emotions to do what i had to. only year later, no surprise, i was diagnosed with depression myself, but only recently i discovered that bpd was the real issue. the point is that she is the main trigger of my abandoment issues and although she is better now she doesn't know how to handle it and she doesn't seem to be able to take care of me like i would want to. we live together and every day there's a trigger and i feel like shit. i have a boyfriend now who supports me but i can't feel better while i don't make things right with her, but i don't know how.

"18f, in a really good place in life, but I can't enjoy it at all- send help so, I'm in a really good place right now.
I have a loving boyfriend who understands my mental illnesses, I'm eating well and sleeping okay, and my career is going well. I'm even goin on vacation soon! so everything seems cool beans

except I am insecure af and I feel like this is all going to come crashing down on me and that my boyfriend is going to leave me again.

okay that sounds really dramatic, but for some background: my boyfriend and I have broken up 3 times before, but each time it gets better and better because we are actively trying to better ourselves &amp; live healthy lives. and like, fuck it is going really good. There's talk about moving in together, finances and college, getting engaged- the whole shit. And it's making me shit my pants. I've realized, many things at this point.

1) my BPD is The Worst™
Everything is going well and I know he wants to be with me (bc, Jesus Christ we talk about engagement???) it doesn't Register in my emotions.

2) I have a history of trauma with going on vacation. While I love going, something really bad always happens when I leave and I really don't want to get all freaky this time and do the whole break up make up things.

3) I am really controlling and manipulative. I hate it, I actively try not to, but I catch myself being controlling everyone sometimes and I know that it's because I don't think people will care about my needs so I manipulate them to meet them; but my boyfriend has proven again and again to actually care so I don't want to do that to him and maybe if I can stop doing that with him, I can do it elsewhere.

4) I am afraid of having anything good. I think, I personally fixate on us breaking up because the alternative is far more scary. The alternative is that we live happy ever after, and then one of us dies. That is fucking terrifying. Getting everything right, and coping with all my shit and then one day my favourite person just doesn't exist in the world anymore. That is so much worse than him leaving me.

5: I fixate on all the negatives. Sometimes, he'll give me one sign of coldness and my mind will freak out and I'll go into ""I am being abandoned"" mode. But, I know that he could just be tired or just annoyed with me or mad or anything but that doesn't decrease his love for me. It gets really bad in texting, sometimes he doesn't text me or texts in a way that feels cold and I will flip. There are always reasonable answers to why he doesn't text, but I always get really hurt about it and feel like he's going to break up with me.


I really want to be better, I am not sure how to cope with these? Kindly give me any suggestions you can!","The expanded size of the tensor (638) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.  Target sizes: [1, 638].  Tensor sizes: [1, 514]"

i have to mentally prepare myself for everything because of my anxiety.
i’m on new meds. i thought they would actually work, for once. but no. it’s giving me major depersonalization. fuck paxil. i needed something to help the anxiety wellbutrin gave me.

i’m in so much pain. i’ve been on every antidepressant. i’ve tried everything. nothing treats my depression, anxiety, none of my symptoms.
it must be nice to be someone who just has depression or anxiety. those two are just symptoms for me. and they’re the least serious ones. 
i’ve read everything about bpd on the internet. the 9 symptoms. all i do is research my illnesses. i need to stop. i don’t think it’s doing me any good. 


no ones going to ever understand. no one can help me. my brain hates me. i can’t live a normal life. i can’t function.
bpd, ptsd. 
i have support. i have a somewhat decent life. but trauma. but my past.
my brain is stopping me from being happy and i can’t take it anymore.
i don’t want to die. but i don’t know what to do.
i don’t think it’s possible for anything to be worse than bpd.
it’s like all of the symptoms take turns. then all at once. it’s a fucking cycle.
my biggest one lately... identity.
i know this is a disaster of a post.
but this is what i need help with the most:

how do i fix my inability to have a stable identity?
i don’t know who i am. i mean i know who i am. but i don’t. i know you know what i’m talking about.

i’m getting better at my relationships. but i think it’s because i’m holding it all in.
i’m in a loving relationship. my boyfriend accepts me. and he knows what i’ve been through. so i’m doing everything i can to keep him in my life, because god knows what would happen if i fucked that up.

i stopped seeing the therapist i used to see, i switched colleges &amp; he worked at the health center. there’s no way to get him back, and we had just started EMDR.

i’m holding it all in to make things easier for everyone else, i per that to them. but i’m going insane again.
why isn’t there a cure? i’m only 21 and refuse to live like this until i die. even though it seems like that’s what the future holds for me.

before i turned 18, before the rape, before i remembered how my parents traumatized me, i was healthy. i was smart. i got accepted to universities. on the varsity swim team. perfect relationship. i was attractive, glowing, amazing. 

then i graduated high school. got raped. boyfriend of 3 years dumped me on the anniversary of my rape. through text. haven’t seen him since then.
been in the hospital 3 times. tried to kill myself.
got diagnosed with bipolar. 
got diagnosed with bpd, bipolar was wrong. 
then
got diagnosed with ptsd.
and major depressive.
did drugs. got addicted to xanax. coke became my best friend. slept with 20 people.
i’m in my 4th year of community college.
i can’t finish my 2 year degree. in psych. haha.

the only thing i have going for me is my current boyfriend. whatever it takes to hold it together, i’ll do it. 

i’m so fucked up and scatterbrained. i’m sure this is a mess like me. 
at least i made it through my xanax withdrawal last summer. it was hell.

"Sometimes doctors don't think to rule out biological causes - I was given a false diagnosis of BPD for ~3 years [Disclaimer: I am 100% not trying to invalidate anyone else's diagnosis. It just never occurred to me that my ""BPD"" might actually have a biological basis, and I don't know if my story could help someone else.]

I was initially diagnosed with BPD due to 2 years of emotional instability, feeling empty and suicidal, acting impulsively, etc. I was on a waiting list for counselling for about 2 years, and then received some 1-2-1 sessions and group mindfullness. The mindfullness and an exercise routine helped me regulate my moods somewhat. The therapist was less helpful. She seemed stumped that I hadn't experienced any trauma as a child, so suggested the BPD had been caused by an unstable childhood because I'd moved twice. This didn't ring very true to me, as I'd always been surrounded by loving stable family members.

During this time I also saw multiple doctors about menstrual problems. I was bleeding pretty much constantly for 5 years and suffered from horrendous cramps. I had a laparoscopy to rule out endometriosis and PCOS and tried 4 different types of birth control.

After 5 years my gynaecologist finally figured out that all the birth control I'd been on were progesterone-based and switched me to a copper coil. All the symptoms started clearing up almost immediately - including the emotional ones. I have a progesterone intolerance that causes mood swings, not BPD. It just took far too long for a doctor to realise that my menstrual and mental issues could have a common cause - hormones. 

It worries me that not a single doctor in 5 years thought of ruling out a biological cause for emotional instability, instead prescribing anti-psychotics and referrals to therapists.","[[{'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.25917160511016846}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.19590026140213013}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.1669096201658249}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.14167098701000214}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.13922421634197235}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.10474777221679688}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.08804580569267273}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.034128203988075256}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.02717113308608532}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.020579911768436432}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.018073054030537605}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.013164154253900051}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.01103950198739767}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.010698254220187664}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.010624796152114868}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.007321551907807589}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.006758141331374645}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.006635999772697687}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.003574531991034746}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.003047248348593712}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.0027165571227669716}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.002686187392100692}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.002310776384547353}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.0021096637938171625}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.0015598461031913757}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.001472216914407909}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.0009770413162186742}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.0009100608294829726}]]"

I feel so disgusted with myself for feeling excited and hopeful and just not being chill about any of this. I thought that maybe if I talked to a friend about my feelings it would help but now I just feel even more disgusted with myself. (They told me it’s not that serious and I should get over it which is fair but lol my feelings have been invalidated for almost a quarter of century, give me afucking break)

Idk it’s like one end, I’m desperate to have someone like me/be attracted to me because it’s something I haven’t really experienced but I also realize that I’m damaged goods and I probably shouldn’t be trying to rope someone in to my madness. But I’m lonely. But I don’t want to hurt people. But I’m lonely. But I don’t want to worry people. And the thought cycle continues.

"Girlfriend with BPD; to keep trying to work things out or just end it? First, throwaway.

I'll [25M] start by saying I really love my girlfriend [25F]. I really do, which doesn't make this easy.

Essentially I am just at the end of my rope with her. Long backstory short, I've always known she's had anger problems. She was able to conceal it pretty well for the first year we were together. But then not only did the anger come out more often with a vengeance, but other behaviors that scream borderline. (My dad is quiet borderline and his mother is borderline who has really improved over the years, so I have a pretty good idea of what BPD can look like.)

She hasn't been diagnosed directly by a professional, but after experiencing a lot of turbulence in our relationship and talking about it with my therapist for several months, my therapist and I sat down and went through the DSM-TR-IV and DSM-V criteria, based off of which she said (assuming my descriptions of her behavior are accurate) my girlfriend is definitely borderline.

With this realization, I knew what she was dealing with, and so I've tried over the past 3 years to be understanding. But tonight I just lost it.

We were at Walmart, and the guy at the self checkout was closing them down. We were going to be the last customers he would take, so he just asked us to move up so he could close the lane with a rope. My girlfriend flipped completely out on him, using a horrific tone with him and telling him how rude and condescending he was to her and how he would dare talk to her like that. We finally walk - me completely embarrassed - up to the self checkout. We're standing there, and quietly (but not as quietly as she thought) she leans over and starts talking about the guy to me. He hears, and he comes over and apologized profusely, letting us know he sincerely did not intend to be rude at all and that he felt bad about it. She doesn't accept his apology and goes off on him again and just yelling in the middle of the Walmart. I'm watching in horror, and then - we'll call my girlfriend Emily - I just scream out ""EMILY, NO. STOP THAT RIGHT NOW. YOU CANNOT DO THAT. HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING."" It just burned me to my core. I thought about my grandmother doing that to other people and my dad doing similar to me, and I just couldn't stand by and let it happen. Needless to say, I got a nice screaming at that lasted a good 45 minutes in the car and back at her apartment, followed by me apologizing to quiet her down then just getting out of there as diplomatically and quickly as possible. An hour later, after getting back to my own apartment, I get a call with her crying and saying how sorry she is and begging me not to leave her.

I do feel bad I lashed out like that and did kind of embarrass her. But the thing that just drives me insane is that she refuses to admit she has things that need to be worked on. Actually, she does admit she has general ""anger issues"" and that sometimes they get taken out on me and others, but refuses to get help because, in her words, ""Therapy is for the weak and it's never helped anybody. It's just so stupid and I don't believe in it."" At the same time, she knows I go to therapy for my own anxiety issues, so that little comment made me feel great... At the same time, to me what she's saying is ""I know I have some kind of issues that I take out on you but I'm not going to do anything about it and keep subjecting you to it."" And she keeps begging me to get engaged soon, but why would I want to get engaged to someone that treats me like that? I mean, I know she can't help it, but I feel like she isn't exactly trying.

Is there any future here? Does anybody have any tips on somehow confronting this? I wouldn't mind working on things, but I just feel like she won't budge. Like it's just getting really out of control to the point where I just can't deal with it anymore. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.","The expanded size of the tensor (905) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.  Target sizes: [1, 905].  Tensor sizes: [1, 514]"
Spiraling I have been doing very well for the last year of keeping my BPD under control I guess you could say. Two weeks ago everything changed and I literally feel like I'm spiraling I don't know how to deal with this anymore. This time I'm left with extreme paranoia among everything else. I was doing so well now I'm back to square one. ,"[[{'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.45310792326927185}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.18936073780059814}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.15657317638397217}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.13810470700263977}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.1211521252989769}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.09521554410457611}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.06475185602903366}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.050850432366132736}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.03870372846722603}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.036182623356580734}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.022991729900240898}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.015179351903498173}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.01306862011551857}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.01229288149625063}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.012141254730522633}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.011875520460307598}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.011476157233119011}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.009111100807785988}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.008701450191438198}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.006138798780739307}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.004879747983068228}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.004869459662586451}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.0041137742809951305}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.004104419611394405}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.004076087381690741}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.0038734953850507736}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.0030085421167314053}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.0019077165052294731}]]"

"The fear of being unlovable I'm almost 30 years old. I was diagnosed with BPD 8 years ago. And while I have grown out of the more reckless behaviors (self harm,  excessive drinking, opioids, smoking, etc), the one issue that I still struggle with today is that fear off abandonment, the fear that no one could love me, that everyone has a hidden agenda. 

Relationships have been hard for me. I've trusted men that not only cheated on me, but one managed to even father children behind my back. I've been sexually assaulted, I've been abused physically, emotionally, verbally.  I've been gaslighted, manipulated, betrayed so many times. So trusting any guy is hard for me to do.

But that life is behind me now and I'm married for almost 2 years and we're thriving. While I know that he loves me, loves me enough to be my husband, and that he takes our marriage seriously, I'm worried that I'll never truly feel that he means it. 

I realize and understand that this is a result of having BPD, this is the one that I truly wish to outgrow.  If it doesn't cost me my marriage, it does cost me on losing out on happy memories I could be enjoying rather than feeling  like it never meant anything. If anyone else has been able to manage this, or had a successful mindfulness technique, any sort of advice would be appreciated.

"Regain life essence in your eyes? (depressive read) This might be a hard one to answer, but it is my biggest challenge in dealing with people. After a good decade of depression and broken relationships and lost ambition, I have a permanent thousand yard stare. Even if I'm in a good mood, people instantly get chills when they see my demeanor. 

Becoming a more positive person and achieving goals might help, but I'm afraid the condition is permanent. 
My biggest fear is that there might be a limit to the amount of torment your soul can take, before it dies and you are left as en empty shell.

"I’m in self destruct mode and I don’t know how to stop So two weeks ago I finally managed to push my boyfriend so far he broke up with me. He loves me but he does not want to be in a relationship with me any more. And is adamant that he will not in the future. However, selfishly he has said he wants to be my friend despite me saying it was a bad idea. So I eventually agree. 

And I keep pushing him further and further away from me even though he has already gone. I realised during my relationship I lost every single friend I had by making him my everything. And now I have no one. I had one friend left who is on her last nerve with me as well, on the verge or ejecting me from her life completely. 

I’ve stared cutting myself again because it’s the only way I can calm down from my daily break downs where I am crying so hard I can’t breathe or think or barely even move. I’ve been thinking of suicide more and more and more. 

I keep trying to tell my ex that I am going to finally go and get therapy for this and I’m going to be better and treat him better and learn ways to cope with my fears and every day we are ‘friends’ I am just pushing him further and further away. It’s like it’s not enough that I’ve pushed him to leave me, now I need to make him hate me as well! And it’s like I’m going down the list of the worst things I can say to him. How to push him away further. Oooh I know!! Tell him I cut my leg wide open. I know! Tell him I have a big sharp knife in my hand whilst I’m freaking out.  

I fucking hate my fucked up brain and this fucked up disorder I have. If this is what the rest of my life is going to feel like I don’t want to live it anyway. It’s fucking horrible. I’m going to die miserable and alone at some point anyway. Why not now? I’ve already lost pretty much everything anyway.

"Obsessing  Hi. 

Short but sweet. I am currently absolutely obsessing over an issue at work. I suffer from bpd and I cannot leave this worry be. Every second I am thinking about it, trying to find some solid solution which I know doesn't exist. I feel sick and heavy hearted with it. 

Is there anything fellow bpd-ers do to distract themselves from obsessive thoughts that I might try? 

Meditation sounds great but my mind is on fire. 

Any help much appreciated.

"I'm scared I have BPD I'm tired I can't stand this anymore. I'm in a bad place again, but everytime I think it's the last time, but this last time happens over and over and over again leaving me exhausted. 

I thought I was just depressed, or weird, an awful person with shitty social skills, no selfesteem, unable to control their behavior and their emotions, not sure of anything in their life, in themselves, in their own brain. 

But the more I read into BPD, it's like my situation finally has a label to describe it. I'm also extremely anxious, extremely obsessive, these last few months I developed an eating disorder as well, I binge and purge, I panic over everything, I have a phobia of talking in front of many people, like presentations or talking in front of crowds, in a classroom etc. All after a series of panic attacks I had in highschool during reading aloud in class. I can't believe I can do anything good, even the skills I got, like I had a job, I worked as a waitress for 2 months, but after some time passed after I left that job I feel like I didn't even do it? Like I can't work, like I have no experience, like I can't do it again. I overanalize everything, my mind never shuts up. I can't believe someone can love me, even the boys that show interest in me, or a boy that many people I know told me had fallen for me, and he showed it, a normal person would go along with it, would see it, would allow it to happen, I felt like it wasn't possible for him to feel like this for me. I got away, I get distanced from everyone. I also snap and I can't control it, or in a conversation I'll start to talk really loud, I get angry easily and I hate it, or I think I come off as angry, I can't control anything. I've lost control over myself I'm scared I'm going crazy. I feel like a problem for everyone. And I read that many people with BPD end up killing themselves and I'm scared because I had dreams as a kid I had dreams as a teen and it's like I've become everything I hated back then. A scared little shit. I'm so disappointed in myself and I'm tired. At the same time I'm scared it's all in my head and I'm just a drama queen, a person who loves being a victim and it's just a flaw of character, I'm scared I'm becoming like my mom, I'm terrified.

"How to deal with insomnia? The last month has been especially bad. It is currently Sunday, 2:50 PM eastern time. I have been awake for 30 hours straight.

Prior to this, I slept 3 hours from 6:30am-9:30am saturday morning. Prior to this I slept from 8am-12pm thursday. Prior to this I slept from 1am-2pm last sunday. So on and so forth. 

This entire month has been a loose pattern like above. I have almost completely cut out caffeine, I might have half a coffee in the morning. Maybe 2 sporadically depending on the day. 

I have been trying to stay away from laying down except for sleep, which I try on a regular basis. But I feel like if I lay in bed for hours on end I am just reinforcing laying awake. 

I have tried an assortment of tea before laying down around 11pm. I take magnesium an hour before I lay down (have also tried not taking it). I have tried showers, baths. I have tried f.lux and bluelight filters on my phone. I have tried putting away all screens and reading. 

Mentally speaking, 90% of the time I operate sufficiently. Some times I am sluggish, but the rest of the time I feel typical. Periodically, around the 16-20 hour mark, I feel like my mind is operating at peak performance. But just because I am functioning, does not mean it is not taking it's toll on me. I am not even sure of the long term effects of consistent sleep deprivation. 

Currently, at the 30 hour mark, some of my symptoms are actually alleviated. Depression seems to be almost none existent after the 20 hour mark typically. Disassociation is sporadic. Psychological cravings for alcohol or substances typically are alleviated and/or fluctuate after the 24 hour mark. Suicidal ideation decreases after the 24 hour mark as well. 

It is a zero sum game because if and when I can sleep the typical 5-7 hours per night, my symptoms become moderate to severe. If I sleep 9-15 hours, my symptoms are severe. 

I have tried several types of prescribed sleep medication, and some knocked me out. But ALL increased my symptoms. And even being knocked out, when I wake in the morning, I never feel rested on them. Yes I have talked to my doctor, have not received much help besides scripts. I have asked about sleep studies, and he just shrugs it off and says nothing is offered in my area.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.","The expanded size of the tensor (553) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.  Target sizes: [1, 553].  Tensor sizes: [1, 514]"

"Going to start hiding BPD diagnosis I'm sure plenty of people here are way ahead of me already, but...I think I'm going back in the closet with respect to BPD. I'm tired of:

""But you don't seem manipulative!""

""Are you sure you aren't misinterpreting [abuse experience] due to emotional reasoning? Maybe you share responsibility but aren't telling us about it?""

""Borderlines are basically soulsucking parasites lol""

It's especially upsetting because a) my parent capitalized on BPD stigma to discredit me in mental healthcare settings and get me hospitalized, and b) my ex used to claim my ""splitting"" on him (which in retrospect was just disagreement), self-injuring, etc was an excuse to *batter* me. He even claimed after we broke up that his current therapist said his behavior was perfectly understandable given the stress of being the partner of a borderline. And given my experiences in therapy and inpatient, I believe it. 

I used to think that by being open about it I could get more understanding out there, but it just keeps hurting me again and again, even in abuse survivor spaces that profess to be welcoming to BPD. think I'm going to just tell everyone I have CPTSD/PTSD, which is true.

"Military Diagnoses Recently I was diagnosed with BPD while attending a unit recommended psychological evaluation. At that meeting the psychologist and the psychiatrist diagnosed me with BPD. Being in the military means this is grounds for an honorable discharge, and that’s fine and dandy. I’m a young man with not many skills, but I feel like I could flourish in the outside world. My parents don’t believe me and tell me that I’m lying just to get out. They’ve even begun the process of having me legally removed from the family, all because I don’t want to carry on the legacy of being in the military like all of the other male members of my family.
I really only have a few good friends and my girlfriend on my side, and even then it’s hard to keep them because some days I look at them like they are these perfect beings and the next day they can do something so small and minor but it still makes me resent them. I guess I’m just coming here asking what do I do? Should I try to fight to stay in knowing I’m putting my mental health at being risk even more, or perhaps just get out and go to college. I don’t have many people to ask for advice and this sub seemed like the best place for me to seek help from people with similar diagnoses. Thanks to all in advance, I appreciate the input.","[[{'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.4600467383861542}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.12227852642536163}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.09236806631088257}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.06472960114479065}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.058948151767253876}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.047558508813381195}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.03881138935685158}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.031374335289001465}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.03104376047849655}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.021549846976995468}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.015977995470166206}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.014739856123924255}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.014709499664604664}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.01448554266244173}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.011375225149095058}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.010751064866781235}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.007780676707625389}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.006447698920965195}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.004297065548598766}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.003968300763517618}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.0029582655988633633}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.0027697826735675335}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.002520740730687976}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.002365906722843647}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.0022887145169079304}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0018654518062248826}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.001508524757809937}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.0005024775164201856}]]"
"I'm not sure what I look like. Is this BPD related? Sometimes I think that if I ever meet myself on the street, I wouldn't recognize me. If I see photos of myself, I know it's me cause of the details, like my hair, my clothes etc. But once my friend was making a joke and photoshopped my face onto somebody else's body and since there was nothing but my face, I honestly just asked who this is cause I just couldn't see it was me. Sometimes I look at some celebrity and think oh, she looks a bit like me. But then I look in the mirror and realize that our faces are nothing alike. 



  I'm not great with faces in general, I have to meet someone for a few times to remember how they look like. So I never related this to BPD, I thought that's just me being me. And granted, I do have a very forgettable face. But I was wondering, could it be somehow related to the lack of identity that us with BPD tend to have? Does anyone else feel this way? At least to some extent?

"Emotional Blackout So I was diagnosed with bpd about 3 years ago and I have tried to not let it affect my life (pretty much impossible as I’ve found out) and it feels like I haven’t felt an emotion in about 2 years, I can’t tell if this is good or bad, I get occasional bursts of emotion (usually anger or sadness) that last about an hour or so at a time, and I can’t tell if this is good or bad, as much as when I do feel something it’s always horrible, just uncontrollable anger, sadness or loneliness, I want to be able to feel something good for once, rather than this hellish emptiness that’s going on 24/7, I see the people around me feeling emotion and I just want to feel like I’m not such a mess, like I’m not so alone and so that I can maybe relate to my friends and family, I don’t really know what I am expecting from this rant but I can’t be the only one that hasn’t felt anything properly can I?? If anyone has any advice as to what I could try to do it would be most welcome. Thanks for reading.

"Ready to live with this thing called BPD I've been in therapy for a couple of years, because of drug abuse. I recently asked to look at my psychologists notes from our sessions. I found in his notes that he suggested I had a personality disorder and he wanted to test me for it, once I got off drugs. He never told me this. Maybe I wasn't ready.   

I looked at different disorders which I thought was completely wrong, until I came by this one called borderline ... he's right and the first week after I found out, I was euphoric. Finally, an answer. Something to work on. Something to accept. A name for the thing that makes me completely obsessed and paranoid about what other people are thinking about me. The thing that used to make me sad just because of some off hand remark. The thing that makes feelings seem unmanagable and overwhelming. 

I'm almost 40, so a lot of the symptoms I worked off myself, throughout the years. I'm intelligent and mentally strong with relatively lasting jobs and friendships, I hold a masters degree and function well in general. I consider myself a lucky individual and rarely feel sorry for myself. I have a vivid sense of humor and irony. I am a hell of a lot more than these symptoms, that only characterize a fragment of my personality. Yet still the cause so much mind- troubles, from time to time. When I start feeling paranoid and left out of a group, it can be excruciating.   

I have some goals, now. I like a good fight. I love taking a beating, even emotionally. (I'm a bit crazy like that). I will need those skills in my immediate future, because I know that everyting is not solved just by getting The Answer.   

But most of all, I will need my will to accept who I am. I'm not going to *fight* BPD. I'm going to *accept* BPD. I will accept BPD, and I will fight any *doubt* I have in myself. I will *fight* the need to adapt to others, rather than follow my own heart. I will *fight* the need for doing drugs, rather than dealing with my emotions.  

It's not easy having BPD. I know because I had it as long as I can remember. But it's not the worst either. Nobody is just *one thing*. We are so much more than those three letters, and as individuals we are as different and varied as any other group of people. With that in mind, BPD is easily acceptable as a part of a good life. Hell, I'll even be proud of mine. When the time comes. ","The expanded size of the tensor (569) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.  Target sizes: [1, 569].

"It’s 430 am and I’ve reached this dark place again. It’s just been such a hard day, my girlfriend of almost 3 months completely blew me off tonight and didn’t make any contact with me the whole night. When she got home around 1030 I tried to go over and talk to her, I knocked on the door a few times but it was dark so I left. Around 1 I saw she was on Facebook so I messaged her, she read a bunch of my messages but didn’t reply. I got increasingly anxious and angry and kept sending messages seeing that she could read them but choosing to not reply. I didn’t say anything too crazy or act like too much of an asshole but I probably sent too many messages and should have left her alone. I just wanted an explanation as to why I was completely ditched and why she didn’t let me know what was happening. Around 2 hours ago I started cutting myself on my leg and having really bad suicidal thoughts. I’m 31 years old, have a few mental health issues and also have herpes.. I know :( if anyone can justify their feelings of never finding someone to love them it’s me.

"New here So, I'm really new to Reddit as a whole, my husband got me lol. It just occurred to me when I saw a post that mentioned  it, that there was probably a sub for it. I'm pleased to find that not only is there  one, but it's not void of life either.

I, have had BPD since I was about 12. I will be 24 in March. I have been through quite a lot, but I've said it all so many times before that I do not intend on spilling it all out unless someone wants to hear it lol.

I'm not looking for sympathy or attention. I just, want someone to talk to. I wanna know that there are people like me.

I get so angry, over nothing. And I lay awake just scared. I've lost any friends I once had, and it's my fault.

"I miss my FP My FP and I had a thing going for awhile, and I genuinely felt like I was on top of the world. I was so ridiculously happy with him. We spent a lot of time together and even when I overreacted and thought he was “leaving me” he always seemed to prove me wrong and reassure me that everything was okay. Recently, he completely shut me out and didn’t talk to me at all for days. This completely broke me, and eventually he told me that he’s just not ready for a relationship. Ever since, I’ve been a complete wreck. I know that it’s my fault and that I’m just too much for him but I want him back more than anything. I don’t know what to do with myself.

"3 of my closest friends are moving away next week and I’m freaking out. [vent] I feel like my heart is breaking times three. 

All of them are independent of each other, and I am in so much pain right now. 

The first one is my ex that I dated for two years. We were planning on going on a campervan trip and traveling around the United States for a year. Things exploded and he said that he had to do the trip on his own. We are still friends, but I feel like I not only failed the relationship, but also missed out on an awesome life opportunity. 

One is a girl that I met my sophomore year of college six years ago. She met a guy and is going to travel in India with him for a year. I am happy for her, but at the same time I’m envious and mad at her for leaving. I am envious because I feel like she is doing what I wanted to do: travel with my lover for a year. I am feeling so many conflicting feelings. I went to her going away party last night and had a panic attack and had to leave. 

The last one is a friend that I met two years ago at work. She is moving to a different state to be closer to her dad. We did not hang out a lot but when we did our relationship was intense. We lived our lives in parallel. 

I am trying hard as hell not to split on all of them, but I am so sad. I feel like they are all abandoning me, but I know they all have their own lives to live. It’s just hard that they are all leaving at the same time. 

The only person I have left is my current partner, and I am scared to death that he will leave me too, so I’m being extra clingy and needy but I think that is pushing him away too. I feel so scared and alone. 

I am trying to do healthy coping mechanisms, but it seems like nothing that I do helps. I do mindfulness meditation twice a day, write in my journal, do art, spend time outside reporting my succulents, but they don’t help. 

I feel like I am going insane. I feel trapped. I want to move away too, but I feel paralyzed. I feel stagnant. How do I survive this? 
 
I don’t expect anyone to answer this, but if you do I appreciate you. I’m sorry. ","The expanded size of the tensor (538) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.  Target sizes: [1, 538].  Tensor sizes: [1, 514]"
"I want to destroy one of my most consistent friendships I have a group of girlfriends I have known since we were freshmen in college.

One of the ladies in the group got married just over a year ago in a destination wedding. I tried hard to figure out how to make it and couldn’t with money and work. I was pretty heartbroken about missing her wedding. A few weeks later I heard from another friend in our group that she was disappointed that I hadn’t congratulated her.

I saw her in November and she said she thought she was pregnant. We had a whole conversation about it being exciting etc. but she ended up having a miscarriage. Then she announced in an email in January that she was pregnant again, had just gotten the positive test, but was not out of the woods yet. I didn’t respond. I was really busy at work and was waiting for a more concrete announcement to say anything. 

Yesterday I got this text from yet another girl in the girl group. “Hey again. [Pregnant friend] mentioned that she hadn't heard from you. Especially given all the emotional turmoil of last year, I think she'd really appreciate a quick few words of congratulations on her pregnancy.”

I know burning down 17 years of friendship is something I would come to regret. But I also feel like fuuuuuuuuck everyone. Why do I keep having to make overtures to her after planning a wedding that I couldn’t make it to? It’s not like she asked me ahead of time if that would work for me. And I don’t feel like I have the emotional energy to be her friend if she is going to keep being upset about me not acknowledging every occasion in her life. If you had asked me before last year if I considered this friend to be selfish or short-sighted, I would have laughed at you and said that was ridiculous.

I really wanted to vent here because I knew you all would understand the impulse to ruin long friendships over petty things. I want to tell her off so badly. I’m full of anger and resentment. I don’t want to create a huge rift in my most solid friend group.","[[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.44807061553001404}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.3545180559158325}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.15535663068294525}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.1024688258767128}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.0688907727599144}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.03923827037215233}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.030023392289876938}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.025889351963996887}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.025627367198467255}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.021822432056069374}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.013554432429373264}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.01054124440997839}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.01040906086564064}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.009094610810279846}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.007590893190354109}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.006595955230295658}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.004569611046463251}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.004549941513687372}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.0034672666806727648}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.003373818239197135}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.0025017992593348026}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.002394345821812749}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.0023568335454910994}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.001976299798116088}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.001780102145858109}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.0015444306191056967}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.0009175254381261766}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.0004266580508556217}]]"
"Can't control how angry I feel I just need to get this out, I'm sorry if it's jumbled. 
This whole weekend my boyfriend blew me off and we argued about it but today I had class and we had a few minutes to spend together after trying to do a project that's been waiting for months. Well he got called away for ""work"" (a problem with some workers planting trees on his property) and he had to leave me to go take care of it. I called him an hour later and asked if he could leave yet to come get me and he said he needs to stay to watch them and he'll call me in 40 minutes. I called him after he didn't call back and he had left to drive his son home since he doesn't like the school bus. He literally drops everything to drive him home almost daily even though his son never wants to spend time together. He just wants to not take the bus and get dropped off at his moms house. Okay so it's an emergency that he can't leave work and has to be there until he needs to taxi his son to his moms. So when I asked if he could leave at all, the real answer was ""yes totally, just not for you."" So why the hell did he say he literally couldn't and emphasize how important it was to stay. I'm so angry because this is just like him. Everything gets prioritized over me on a regular basis and once again the things that are ""emergencies"" can easily get tossed aside if something other than me comes up. It would be one thing if his son was a little kid or if he needed something or even wanted to spend quality time together but no, he just doesn't like having to take the bus. 

I'm so fucking angry and hurt and fucking jealous of a kid as stupid and selfish as that sounds. It would take 10 minutes to come and get me. I told him we could go right back there if we needed to. We could have picked up his son together, we get along. Anything. I was in a good mood, it's not like I was being difficult to be around.

"Self destructiveness, manipulation, advice I need advice. I have talked at length on here about the things leading up to this, but the short version is this. I phoned various crisis lines drunk and hysterically depressed over an eight hour period last week. I don't have a long term history of this behaviour, but I am just now doing trauma work in therapy for the first time ever. I have made great changes in self care and being reliable, but I am having less positivity with regulating my emotions.

I have agreed to any and all measure, groups, meetings, the pill that makes you sick and rehab if it comes to that. I am now firmly commited in a way I wasn't before to not drinking. 

But of course the crisis line thing I was detained and brought to hospital. I should have just explained my concerns to my worker today normally. I should have just said, I know I was very difficult to deal with that night and I understand I have to do better. But that the fact the hospital simply let me sleep a few hours and let me leave without any aftercare, without seeing anybody for even ten minutes of counseling considering I came in suicidal. That I never saw a doctor and was given no release paperwork or referrals seems wrong to me. 

I am thirty six years old and I have been in psych three times in nineteen years for a total of sixteen days. I should have pointed that out and point out every other worker I dealt with during that crisis, as well as my therapist, did their job. But the hospital didn't and I know I have a role to play but I have struggled not to be a burden on the system and I feel they let me down and would like to complain. I have never done that to an organisation in my life, but I am now very scared of what will happen to me if I go into my local hospital.

And I did say this. After I threatened my worker with getting of disability support. I just felt on one hand if I burned my life down, fine I deserved it, or he would be forced to advocate for me with the hospital. He saw through this and told me not to threaten him. I didn't mean it like that, not really but I guess I did. We have a great relationship and this is the first time he has said anything like it to me. I apologised and he seemed fine, he understood I was didn't mean it like that and accepted it as a misunderstanding. 

He even did agree to advocate for me with the hospital. We became friendly and chatty and made more plans for me to do. 
I just don't know how to stop. I can do the responsibility and self care and probably get better with emotional regulation since I have stopped drinking. But how do you stop the desire to burn your life down or half knowingly manipulate people when you feel desperate enough?.","The expanded size of the tensor (600) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.

"I feel like the universe is asking me to die I feel like I have always had BPD, I've still got vivid memories of elementary school classes, and recess. Neither were ever enjoyable to me, I'd spend most of the time stargazing why life happen to me. 

I still managed to live through bullying, and a home that was filled with anger, stress and fear. I managed to survived because I thought life had a greater meaning for me. High school was very much the same, I was seeking more attention, and I started to let out some of the anger inside of me. I don't fully understand my anger, but for all the laughs, attacks sent my way, I feel like it is justified and thus, I can't really ever let it go. 


It's turned me into what my friend calls a black hole. I always seek the attention, the riches, the love, the respect for my ego. A strong gravitational force that devours and destroys anything nearby, always agitated and never seeking the positive side of life - only to taint it as black as I can.


All of that was said in order to try to kill my ego, while I was on a LSD trip. The conversation started about that and went on to them telling me to change, to not care about my ego, and to kill myself mentally. My mental self is the ultimate defense that I have to protect me, this hate, sorrow, shame, guilt make a strong armor. Yet still, when my friend told me to do what would bring me peace. I could only imagine dying, I felt at peace with the thought, but in distress at the thought of no longer existing. It felt like it was a general agreement from them. 


It feels like those thoughts were forced upon me too, I've always loved the idea of suicide but never actually wanted to kill myself. I'd prefer for death to find me so it's not as painful to my environment. 

However, on LSD, it felt like I was the unhappiness of everyone and that I was bringing unhappiness, anxiety, stress to society and life. Or so were the words I was fed by those closest to me.... 

I'm now two days post-trip and I feel like I'm the black sheep with the darkest eyes in town.... almost every coworkers asking me what's going on with me; I don't even know where to begin. 

I don't want to live, but I don't want to die either, my ego and darkness have taken control over me but I have such a hard time to let them go - they're my defense mechanism. I feel like dropping it isn't an option; I can't take anymore pain.  I'm lost at sea, but there's so much comfort in knowing I'm the only person able to keep myself alive, free of the suffering from drowning and free of the suffering from society.

I just wish I could let it all go. ","The expanded size of the tensor (622) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.  Target sizes: [1, 622].  Tensor sizes: [1, 514]"
"Fast acting meds for BPD? Hi guys,


I recently got diagnosed with BPD and so far in terms of treating me they keep throwing antidepressants at me.
I do sometimes have down days but my biggest issue I'm having is my psychotic episodes, lack of ability to control moods (to a point I've had to make myself stop seeing my kids as I don't trust myself), impulsiveness, hallucinations and delirium.
My thing is I'm pretty good at talking myself round usually but I can't listen to myself mid episode.
I don't like the idea of being constantly drugged, I'd prefer an immediate sort of relief maybe that lasts a few hours.
I used to take propranolol for anxiety a few years ago and my Dr told me to use that ad hoc.
I am waiting for an invitation to a DBT group therapy course because I think that will help me massively.
But for the meantime just to regulate myself and make me better so I can see my kids again I need medicinal help.
Do you guys have any ideas of things I can research to suggest to my doctor when I go see them?","[[{'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.23994198441505432}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.1642342507839203}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.10346394032239914}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.08232542872428894}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.07190503180027008}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.06205453723669052}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.057334061712026596}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.04255034402012825}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.039503492414951324}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.0234227254986763}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.023022212088108063}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.02007647417485714}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.016477437689900398}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.015949120745062828}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.007245013955980539}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.006461465731263161}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.00474941311404109}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.004297277890145779}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.0041635544039309025}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.0030568037182092667}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.00287078320980072}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.002706612693145871}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.002318768063560128}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.001953400205820799}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.0016577771166339517}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.0008839154033921659}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.0006237347843125463}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.0002936160017270595}]]"

"Constant guilt Hi guys, 

First ever Reddit post! 

Just wondered who else feels guilt very easily. I feel bad at the thought of upsetting/annoying anyone. I feel guilty every time I go on a night out, every time I don’t do enough during the day. Guilty for not being a better person. 

It’s seeing the people around me seemingly having their shit together. They go the gym, have relationships, work and play.

"How to Stop Crying Some background — these past few months have been really hard for me as a person living with BPD. I recently failed to complete a partial hospitalization program which confirms the idea that I literally can’t finish anything I start. 

Through all of this I’ve been heavily reliant on my long distance boyfriend. I am the absolute worst — the distance kills me because I need him way more than he could ever need me (I’m sure you all know what I mean). Every time I talk to him I end up bawling. Real waterworks. The kind of crying you just can’t stop. I cry to him for hours and then tell him he’s not meeting my needs and come to him with a list of the places he has gone wrong. I know this is typical BPD behavior for me, but I actually don’t know how to stop. Does anyone have a similar experience? I honestly think this has ruined my relationship and there’s no turning it around. It’s all centered on my mental health now and any positive aspects or things we used to laugh about or whatever have all faded out.

I was in utter disbelief. Why would anyone do that? lol I can’t decide if it’s just so pathetic that it’s laughable or if I should be offended. To make matters worse, when I brought it up to him he basically told me I was crazy and that my feelings weren’t valid. What the hell is going on here? Am I wrong to feel upset about this?

"I think I might have BPD. Hi. Just for a bit of background, I'm  21/f with a history of anorexia. It's become apparent recently that I had been numbing feelings of depression, anxiety and loneliness through starving myself. I often flit from happiness, to deep sadness , to a state of numbness where I feel no motivation to do anything. Although I have never gone through with them, I frequently get intrusive thoughts of harming myself (cutting, pulling hair, head banging etc) .

But most worrying is my feelings towards friendships and relationships. I get obsessed with certain people and am so terrified of being rejected or losing them that I struggle to concentrate on anything else. 

I recently went on a couple of dates with a guy I really like. They went well, but now I find myself obsessively checking my texts, thinking about him way more than I deem 'normal'. I have felt the same way towards friends and previous relationships before. I am aware that this sounds a little creepy, but I can't help it. I want an romantic and sexual relationship so much it hurts. 

Apologies for the probably largely incoherent rant! 

Also, I was diagnosed with Asperger's at 16, however I have reasons to doubt this diagnosis.

"I'm in a no-label relationship with my FP who will move away in a few months I love this guy who also happens to be my FP. We're in a no-label ""relationship"", I don't know how else to call it. He has commitment issues so that's why. I don't think he even likes me. He's probably not even ""loyal"". He ""cheated"" on me once. He doesn't even give me any affection at all. It feels like he only wants me for sex. Maybe he even still talks to the girls he used to fuck. He's had sex with more than 50 people before because he used to be a manslut before I met him (I'm not slut shaming though).

Every moment hurts but I can't let go of him. I've grown attached and dependent on him, and now I don't know how to let go.

What's more is that in a few months, he'll move away to the other side of the world. I'll never see him again. He doesn't want to have a long distance relationship. 

I don't know how I'll be able to cope. Maybe I'll turn to alcohol and sex? But I'm currently taking medication so I can't drink. And I'm demisexual so I don't really get attracted to strangers - or to anyone else, for that matter. So I don't know how I'll be able to cope.

I talked to my psychiatrist about it and she said that I should just wait for college which is in a few months and I'll find someone better. But I'm scared that I won't be able to find anyone. And I need to know what to do now at this very moment.

"How to deal with a FP issue My husband has BPD. I’m his FP. Truth be told, he’s mine as well, but in a healthy way. In the beginning of our relationship I was much more codependent than I am now. I’ve worked very hard on myself during the last few years to be happy with myself for who I am, and not just because of what others think of me. Lately we’ve been running into an issue around the FP thing. If I choose to hang out with anyone else, be it drinks after work with coworkers or going out with my team after a race, he views it as me choosing other people over him. I guess when it’s super simplified, that is what I’m doing. In that particular moment. But overall, I’m not putting anyone else above him. 

So how is the best way to navigate this? He’s getting treatment and we think we’ve found a marriage counselor that specializes in BPD relationships, just waiting to see if their hours work with our schedules. But in the meantime, I don’t want to disregard every other relationship in my life, but I also want my husband to feel safe and validated and taken care of and loved.

"Bpd in NHS system? Hey, anyone had experience with getting a bpd/eupd diagnosis in NHS system? Or any other disorders for that matter.

"Lost siser Hi Everyone,

I lost my 27-yo sister earlier this week who suffered with BPD. My family and I spent the better part of 16 years by her side as she struggled with BPD, eating disorders, substance abuse, and self-harm. She passed under difficult circumstances and the police are involved. I am heartbroken, but I also have a question. 

My family and I struggled to find good treatment for her. When my parents were financially-able, they spent in the 6-figures to help her (this was with good private insurance). When she was pediatric, everyone seemed to be clueless of how to help us, even in psychiatric settings. As an adult, she was often non-compliant and wanted to sign herself out of programs, even when she was a danger to herself (and at times others). When she was ready for treatment, the insurance would kick her out in a few days or weeks. 

Every doctor she saw appealed the companies for long-term residential care. My sister struggled in outpatient settings. She might have been able to step down to one but desperately needed in-patient long-term care. When she was willing to go into these programs, they weren't available.

Eventually, she ended up on Medicare/Medicaid because she couldn't keep a job and was having constant health issues from damaging her body. On these programs, very little was allowable. Ultimately, she ended up self-medicating with heroin, and died of an OD. (When she tried to seek help for this, no beds were available because she hadn't been court-ordered to go). 

It seems like this was unnecessary. I think there is a good chance my sister could still be with me if the mental health system were improved and insurance companies were held accountable to provide services for families. After reading articles, there is clearly a biological component to this disease related to structures in the brain. 

This is my long-winded way of asking- how do I make a change in the world so no other family has to go through this? Nobody else should ever need to experience this in their life. I do not want my baby sister to have died in vain.

"I think I've FP'd my therapist. For the first time in my four years of having therapy I have a male therapist. At first I was really resistant to that, just because I thought it would be weird talking to him about intimate things between my partner of three years and I. I've been seeing this therapist since August 2017, and recently he asked me to email him every day once I'd completed my daily mood tracking cards and food diary (I had issues with completing them, so emailing him was incentive). At first I just emailed him a couple of pictures off the internet that said ""done"", but then I decided to turn it into a creative exercise (I'm a graphic designer so I gravitate towards that stuff). 

But I've noticed that this simple act of emailing him something personal that I've created, every day, has caused me to grow a weird emotional attachment. I keep checking my phone every day constantly to see if he's emailed back. I keep looking out for him when I'm in group (I'm in a four day a week therapy programme). I think about him a lot, but not in THAT way. A friend of mine suggested that maybe he's become an FP (favourite person).

So, I wanted to know, has anyone else FP'd their therapist? What have you done about it? How did you bring it up with them, if at all (especially if they're of the opposite sex)?

NOTE: I've been with my boyfriend for three years and fully intend to marry him. This attachment to my therapist isn't romantic at all.

"Really bad issues with attachment and abandonment I'm not sure if this is related to my BPD or not, but if not any suggestions for another subreddit will be appreciated.

So I've had attachment issues for a long time. It's on the other side of the FP problem though. Although I have attachment/abandonment issues of getting too invested in someone, etc, similar patterns, I'm also terrified of commitment and intimacy of any sort.

I can be friends with people but as soon as there's any indication they feel anything more for me I feel a terror I can't describe and immediately try to detach myself from them. It doesn't happen beforehand; I could totally be very much in love with someone or crushing on someone but the second they suggest going further the fear takes over everything else. 

I don't know if this has to deal with any abandonment fears, this whole fear of commitment and intimacy. I want a relationship but I run very fast as soon as someone discloses their feelings to me. I have a close friend who told me a while back they might have feelings for me, I told them I want to stay friends, and I was flattered for 2 seconds before feeling incredibly anxious and terrified and cringing at any form of affection they give me now (though before they told me, I was totally fine with them being affectionate towards me and I was to them too). I keep reading into it, I'm afraid me continuing to be nice will just be leading them on, and I genuinely think I can't deal with people being in love with me. I'd hate to ruin our friendship but I'm afraid this is where it's going if I can't deal with this anxiety. 

Any advice is appreciated &lt;3 I don't want to ruin more friendships or my future or wtv by emotionally running as fast as I can out the door as soon as someone indicates a strong level of attachment to me, whilst I can only be extremely unhealthily attached to people I never have a chance with.

"Help me please I'm going to start this off saying I'm sorry for the long post, but I could really use some help. Also, trigger warning. I talk about self harm and suicide attempts.

I am 16 and was diagnosed with BPD about 9 months ago. Before that, I was diagnosed with an entire boatload of different things, my diagnosis switching all the time. Last year, I had two suicide attempts. Neither one of them was because I wanted to die, my first one, I was trying to get a reaction out of my mom, and the second one was a cry for help. 

After the first suicide attempt, I got into a relationship that lasted for 7 months (I won't go into detail over why it ended) about a week after we broke up, I cut myself bad enough I need stitches. I refused to go to the hospital, and was in a horrible mindset at the time so my parents called the police. I was in the pediatric psych unit for a week and then got out. Fast forward a week after that and I was sent to a residential treatment facility (Tanager Place in Iowa) for 4 months. When we set my discharge date there were certain rules in place: 

No smoking
Have to go to school

That was it for the most part. I have been home since January 4th, and I am now smoking(my parents buy the cigarettes for me) and I havent gone to school in over 2 weeks. (I did have my wisdom teeth out and was sick, but 4 of those days I flat put refused to go to school)

When I was in the residential treatment facility, I learned a few things, like distress tolerance, and I lost all urge to self harm, though I occasionally had the urge to overdose, not because I wanted to die, but because I wanted out of my situation.

I have now been home just over 2 months, and as I said, I'm breaking my parents rules, and not only that I have been very suicidal and had the urge to self harm for the first time in over 6 months, tonight.

I don't know what to do. Lately (past 2-3 weeks) I have felt hopeless, alone, confused (like I dont know what I'm doing with my life) I know what I want to do in the future, but I'm so overwhelmed with what I'm feeling now that I feel paralyzed. I don't have the motivation to do anything. I'm going to school tomorrow, but already I'm planning out which classes to skip. I am EXTREMELY lonely, but I'm making no effort to make friends because I don't trust anyone.

I see a therapist weekly, and I see my psychiatrist soon. I don't feel like my medication is working properly, and I HATEHATEHATEHATEHATE taking medication.

How do I cope with this? I feel paralyzed and stuck, I feel like ending it just so that I don't feel this way anymore. I know that I won't do that, but I'm not sure what I SHOULD do.

"Getting Better.... So I had toxic behaviors which made me lose my boyfriend and we ended on okay terms. 

I went back to school. Getting a new job. Starting therapy soon with my favorute therapist. Learning how to drive and sometimes it sucks being lonely (have no IRL friends) but im getting by. 

I also have no desire for a relationship or to even date. Infatuations are like 2 days long and then I snap out of it. I listen to my intuition now and I'm researching witchcraft (which is already helping me become more peaceful and look at things differently). 

I still miss my ex very much and I have my bad days but I have my good days and overall, I've been stable. 

Few weeks ago, as I was coming to terms with my toxic behaviors... admitting my guilt and faults... i became so suicidal and depressed. 

But somehow I got out of it and I'm thankful. This is barely the beginning and more work is to be done, but I say there is honestly hope. 

Edit: I am twenty. I no longer care for my diagnosis. It helps that i left fb and have been using bpd threads and groups much less than before. I stopped trying to figure out my sexuality too... i love who i love. I have what i have... and I'll do my darn best with it. 

I hope all of you are getting better bit by bit.

"Do you ever wonder how far off your thinking is? As a person with BPD, I always wonder how much of my thinking is considered ""flawed"" or ""distorted"". But because nobody can ever really be inside my mind and understand the concepts and visuals and my ""inside voice"", I'll never really know how much of the deepest part of me- my mind- is just not normal, or even wrong.

It's really frustrating, because things that I strongly feel or believe could be so totally off, in the eyes of society. but I also wrestle with the idea that everyone else is on a lower level of thinking, and because of my enlightened mind, I'm actually thinking on a frequency more intuitive than what's ""normal"", but the greater percentage of society sees me as ""distorted"", and ""sick"".

"I just met a girl with BPD, need some tips Ok, first of all, i know this is going to be a challenge as i have been warned several times and i did read a bit about BPD, but i really like her and want to help her out.

The thing is, i have been through some bad stuff in my past, i know what it's like, and i would have loved some help and comprehension, even though i'm as good as i can be now.

Today she had her first attack with me, basically jelousy.

Any tips to help her manage that?

Thanks!

"Obsessive but not so much compulsive I don't feel like I am OCD at all but I am very, for lack of a better word, stalkery. I obsess over things. For example, I ""check up"" on a select group of people on Facebook, sometimes several times a day. My boyfriend, my ex-husband, his new girlfriend (who used to be a friend of mine and back stabbed me, long story).
Boyfriend: If he leaves his phone unattended, I look through it. If he catches me, I tell him what I'm doing. Up until recently, I would log on to his Facebook (which I changed the settings bc he used to get notifications when someone logged in) and go through his activity log, recent searches, all that stuff. I would sign on to his Facebook messenger and go through his conversations, going back years. I look through his search history on his phone, I sign into his playstation account and look at any messages. I check his snapchat. Basically anything I have his password to, I go through. I told him to change his password, which he did but I still will look through his phone when I get a chance, usually when he is sleeping. Even though I have him blocked, I use a family member's profile I use to look at what he posts, who likes it and comments and then I stalk those people. I also have a file on him I keep in my desk at work with his bank account info, ssn, answers to what security questions may arise, his credit report, anything I feel I need.

My ex-husband: No longer friends on Facebook but I login to family member's to check his profile as they are still friends. I have also tried logging into his account several times.

Ex-husband's girlfriend: Has me block and not friends with family members but I go on to see what she comments on my other 
Facebook ""friends"" posts.
I came to believe that she is moving into my old house with my ex. I drive by frequently. I still have his garage door programmed in my car so sometimes I open it, they ""hide"" her car in there so I won't see it. My most recent plan is to watch the house and when no one is there, go in and move things around. I want them to know it was me but not be able to prove it.
I want these people to be afraid of me. I want to control them with fear. I realize it is very unhealthy but I can't stop.

Strangers: If I have posted something or commented on a public Facebook post and someone replies with something that rubs me the wrong way, I will stalk them. This summer I joined a Facebook group and a woman (20's maybe?) with a fake name and set very private (because she had been repeatedly kicked off and needed to make new profiles) commented something on a post of mine I didn't like. She only had two pictures viewable on her account. I looked at everyone who liked the pics and checked all their profiles until I found out a relative then combed through pictures and comments to find her name, her daughter's name, her exhusband, family members, etc. I looked up her address and cross referenced it with the county assessors office (she lived in a nearby state, not the state where I live). Once I was sure I googled how long it would take for me to drive there. From start to finish was only about 25 minutes.

These are just some of my behaviors. I don't want to hurt most of these people but I wouldn't put it past me with my BPD. Mostly I want them to believe that I am capable of destroying their lives and be afraid of me. As long as I don't threaten or assault anyone, they cannot file for a no contact or protective order.

I understand this isn't healthy but when I get obsessive about it, I can't stop. I also get obsessed with other things, eating the same food, having the same routine every day, etc but this is heavily interfering with my life. I also realize the primary factor is these are all people who have badly hurt my feelings. Does anyone else do this? How can I convince myself to want to stop?

TL:DR I'm an obsessed stalker and I'm afraid I'll take it too far one day. I want to stop but I don't want to stop and sometimes I'm unable to stop once I start.","The expanded size of the tensor (936) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.

"Bad experience with fluoxetine? I was diagnosed with BPD a little over a year ago, and shortly after that I got prescribed to fluoxetine 10mg (take 1 for 2 weeks, then take 2 daily)

For the first two weeks when I was taking it as just 10mg it made me dissociate like hell. It was constant, and came at the worst times like during school, but as soon as I started taking 2 capsules a day it stopped.

I was wondering if anyone here had the same or at least similar experience? And is it worth talking to my doctor about?

"Pill PTSD? Is there a such thing? When I was 13 I overdosed on acetaminophen in an attempt to take my life. Ever since then I've had a severe aversion to pills of any kind. I will find any alternative or suffer through various ailments (headaches, a cold, pain management etc.) to avoid taking a pill. Unfortunately I've had a long battle with mental illness and just this past year I made another attempt on my life and ended up in the hospital with a BPD diagnosis. I'm prescribed 100mgs of sertraline and 150mgs of burproprion to manage this.  Every attempt to take my meds ends up with intense anxiety and gagging. As soon as i feel that pill in my throat i get intense flashbacks to that horrible time when i was 13. I cannot take the pills. I try again and again but I absolutely dread it. To the point when I will have anxiety attacks when I know the time is coming to take the next dose.

 My question is, is there an alternative to pills for these medications? Honestly I would prefer to take an injection every day than battle this ongoing fear. I desperately need to figure this out as my life literally depends on it. Any information would be greatly helpful.

"Signs that a BPD cares for you? How can one know that what you two have is special? That she really does care for you, in whatever capacity she/he has? 

We are friends at this stage now, but before that we were exclusive for a bit. Prior to that, she had a guy in every city to 'hang out with' even though she was already engaged to someone else. When we met, that was all in the past. I am just trying to figure if all that time with her, meant more to me than her and didn't even register to her as an emotional connection. We were together for six months, and it was great, she wanted to spend every awake moment together, and the intimacy was good too, she even initiated it. When she had to go abroad, we went back to being friends, and she cried hard on our goodbye, but when i asked her to write something for me to remember her by, she wrote : ""Thanks for liking me and celebrating me at the worst time of my life. I can never repay what you did for me and on that morbid note, take care!'' Which felt again it was about her than me. I would have to go by clues (spending time with me and such) to figure out if I meant more to her than her other relationships. Even when she is away now, we are in constant touch, but I can't get over the fact that she is also in touch with all the men she has ever been with, and they still offer her invites to hotels and such, which she declines, and then meets them for coffee still or offers coffee herself. 

Regardless, when she was visiting home for two weeks, we ended up spending every awake moment together again. We said good bye again and she cried saying she wishes there was more she could do for me. her flight ended up being delayed for four hours, and she asked to see me again in those extra few hours we got. I feel confused and trying to process this hurts my head more than a headache.

I want to stay and be there for her, be her friend as I know she is important to me and I care for her, so any guidance would be much appreciated.

"Any ways to cope with myself? I’ve been in therapy for about 7 years and I don’t feel any better than when I started.  I’m on meds but they help most with my social anxiety.  I ruin every relationship I have, and it makes me feel horrible about myself.  I ended things with my life long best friend several months ago because I was so sure she was sick of me but now I just think I was misinterpreting everything.  She still talks to me and is still a “friend” but I haven’t hung out with her or anything.  I’ve ended things with every other friend I had and now all of my friends are new friendships and I’m terrified I’ll ruin them too.  I just don’t want to be so alone, I hate this, I hate myself.  My ex-best friend knows about my BPD and is very supportive but I know her new friends have replaced me and I will never be able to be where I was with her.  I am just wondering if anyone has any ideas of ways to cope.  I need something to help me carry on and I feel so hopeless.

"Making friends at university Hey all. I'm going off to college this year (class of 2022). Throughout high school I've struggled making and maintaining relationships, due to me having a hard time interacting with people in general. People will say things that a normal person would obviously respond to but I usually am at a loss. My attempts at counseling have not yielded much. Anyone have any advice or thoughts regarding how I can be less socially awkward at college?

Before someone asks, I don't have ASD or social anxiety but I am kind of wacko (highly obsessed with specific academic interests) and have BPD.

"This is some next level torture. I don't know where to begin. All of it. It's just... nobody understands. I wish they could see, but their ignorance must be bliss. I wish I had the luxury of being able to write people off as monsters. I may lose myself in the moment, in the heat of things but I always come back to reality. And when I gain my perspective back, it's a more forgiving perspective than any ""healthy"" person I know has.

"Doing everything I was told to do by doctors and therapist and I still don’t feel better. Sleep deprived and annoyed Apologies for incoming rant I’m just not sure what to do anymore.

I have various anxiety disorders and BPD and last year when I was diagnosed I was told to get a lot of stuff in order that would help me manage symptoms better (cause I couldn’t get to a group therapy thanks to social anxiety and agoraphobia and no one would give me a 1-to-1 therapy... -_- )

So I’ve been doing what they told me: eating right and not having tonnes of junk, exercising, going out a little bit and pushing myself, sleep cycle

Been trying to get into a good sleeping routine and getting up early, not using pc or phone or tv before bed ect, exercising in the morning and being tired all damn day and not allowing myself to nap so I sleep at night, went to bed today just after 8pm, exhausted.. tossed and turned for hours without a restful sleep and I’ve been wide awake since 2am, wtf gives! I’m so annoyed and tired and sick of this. So now I can’t exercise tomorrow because I already feel wrecked and I can’t sleep. 

I’m doing everything I was told and I’m still anxious about everything, still can’t sleep or function like a normal human, feel like crap :(

"Bank card info was stolen So my fiancee's bank card info was stolen and so she had to cancel the card. The new one won't be here until thursday and we're so broke it isn't even funny.

Her bank doesn't have a branch anywhere in our state, and I have no money as a full time student. We just had one of the biggest fights we've ever had over her not wanting to deal with the issue, won't talk to me about it and help me plan what to do. Because in part of my BPD I've become so distanced from all of my family and friends there's no way I can ask any of them for help. I feel like I've already asked them for enough.

All in all, I'm having an incredibly shitty monday. But I'm mostly keeping it together; I've only cried twice today.

Thanks for reading my vent. Time to go searching for change in the sofa cushions!

"Pmsing (trigger warning--suicide) My mental health is so much worse when I am nearing the end of my cycle. I feel okayish right now, but all I could think about late last night was suicide. This is after a wonderful valentine's date and good day. I just laid there quietly sobbing and thinking of what a relief it would be to not exist anymore. To not worry about my medical and school debt, my shitty family, nonexistent friendships, finding something fulfilling to do, money, etc. It took me one second of feeling bummed about a prior argument, and the most intense waves of sadness ensued. Like painful waves through my face, my throat, my stomach, through my entire body. Just so much physical pain and hurt. And now I almost can't remember what that actually felt like? I seriously just felt so crushed and done and like if my dad's family didn't love me and treat me well, I would really want to end it now. These feelings come and go all the time, but the closer I get to my period, it becomes unbearable. I hate this. Just venting. I'm sure some of you can relate :( 


Another thing--whenever I see BPD come up like somewhere in /r/relationships, people either completely condemn us as human garbage or (not as cruelly) say don't be with bpd people if they aren't getting treatment. I literally have almost no money and that's just not an option. I read the dbt workbook sometimes and other resources and try to be self aware of my emotions, but it just sucks. A lot of struggle with work and finding well paying work, so it's ironic that we can't get the treatment we need that would probably make that much more possible. :/","[[{'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.8185451030731201}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.22483490407466888}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.06505407392978668}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.02552170678973198}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.02357233129441738}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.016045475378632545}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.015890605747699738}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.01586664281785488}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.01393803022801876}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.012877924367785454}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.01090016309171915}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.009056133218109608}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.00896376557648182}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.008338278159499168}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.007632249966263771}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.007016674615442753}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.005116980988532305}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.004644142463803291}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.004591997247189283}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.0037221137899905443}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.003320664633065462}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.0032711676321923733}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.0027896263636648655}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.00201249192468822}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.0019985989201813936}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.0016438663005828857}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.0006127327214926481}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.00046093709534034133}]]"

"EMSAM/MAOI experiences? Hi all, 

Hope today is one of the good ones for you. I'm wondering if anyone here has experience with MAOI medication for their symptoms? 


My own experiences with EMSAM and depression have led me to want to recommend it to someone in my life living on the BPD spectrum. While I've found a plethora of clinical evidence, it would be good to hear anyone's personal experiences with MAOIs, and Selegiline in particular. 

Thanks.

"Sandplay therapy Has anyone else tried it? I hadn't heard of it before but my current therapist practices it.
I have made a 3 pictures so far and am using it to make more sense of myself (though it can be used in multiple ways). 
And it's nice, seeing parts of myself outside myself and having more symbols to work with. For me it's helping with integrating a sense of self and seeing how I feel about it. And it works better for me than words sometimes.
And afterwards I'd feel like I understand myself better.    

&amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  
*Personal details about it that might sound kind of wishy-washy(not everyone's cup of tea):*

First image I made was a general map of my mind (light side,morality/logic,fantasy,dark side, anxiety,depression) which turned out to be nicely symmetrical.. and I hadn't planned on making it at the time. After going back home, I felt pretty connected to myself and managed to mentally reintegrate an old imaginary friend back into myself, which felt nice.. and a bit later found my middle-school self who was in a lot of pain (she turned out to be the source of my neediness).  
Second one was emptiness.. which turned out to be really peaceful. There was only a spiral with a hole in the middle and a red lotus in the corner.. It was after finding my middle-school self, so I found it to be healing.  
And third image (which was today) was darkest/angry/teenagey part of me.. which was a snake covered with the darkest things I could find in the room. But looking at it, I realized that it's actually just self-protection, and more importantly, I don't hate it and I don't want to get rid of it. What might need work is what I actually perceive to be a threat but that's a different thing.   
And while it doesn't work for most things (it's not a substitute for talking in general), it does do a good job of helping me understand myself a bit more.. which in a way helps with everything else.","[[{'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.5096577405929565}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.2965393364429474}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.16836859285831451}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.03967035561800003}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.038457904011011124}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.03627295792102814}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.016995424404740334}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.01488492451608181}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.013881704770028591}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.013783764094114304}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.013756843283772469}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.009980681352317333}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.007119837682694197}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.006193635985255241}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.005568601656705141}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0055213915184140205}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.005172481760382652}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.004701657686382532}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.0031674932688474655}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.0030944733880460262}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.002777393674477935}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.002614291850477457}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.0022214390337467194}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.0018421270651742816}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.001350246137008071}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.0013379697920754552}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.0008359405328519642}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.0008003142429515719}]]"
"I was diagnosed with BPD yesterday. I guess everything just makes sense now. Every action in my life, every reaction, every friendship and relationship ending. 

I have long suffered through Depression and Anxiety. I knew the symptoms and I hit most of them, but I always knew it was more than that, I just didn't know what. I've been having a lot of panic attacks lately and went back to cutting. My fiance pushed me to make a psychiatrist appointment because it was honestly getting so bad. 

This Psychiatrist asked me questions that no other had asked. She was so thoughtful and insightful. She really got to the root of everything. She said she had a hunch so she asked me a questionnaire. It was like...a book written about me. All these weird behaviors described perfectly. So here I am at age 28, finally  diagnosed with the correct disease. 

I have a lot of emotions going on. I'm so scared/relieved/sad. I'm very lucky in the fact that I have a supportive fiance and (a couple) of good friends. This would be much harder if I didn't have them. 

I start my therapy next week. She also encouraged me to exercise and cut down on caffeine. It was also suggested I start a journal and list things I'm grateful for every day.

So that's my little story. Thank you for listening. I'm grateful to have found a community of people that will actually, for once in my life, understand what the hell it is that I'm talking about.

"I dont know how to feel anymore Hi guys, new here but can relate with so many of you. 

I am currently going through court for custody of my 4 year old daughter and up until christmas was in a great relationship with a man for 2 years. We are still living together but he hit a wall saying he no longer wants to be with me but will stay here to help me get custody. 

We worked things out, not in a relationship but for the past month we have been acting exactly like that, we had an argument last night and things were said but its really annoying me. He says im calling him a liar because im telling him how hes feeling but apparently according to him hes only been cuddling/having sex ect. Because he feela pity for me. I told him hes emotionless because he hates any time i cry and never tells me how he feels.

"Relationship Advice My 27 year old girlfriend has quiet BPD. A few weeks ago she, completely out of the blue, told me we were breaking up. She seemed very different while she was doing it and showed no emotion. I should add that we'd just moved in together the week before and things had been going well.

I am assuming that this is what you guys call splitting. My question is, does this mean all the love she had for me is gone for good? If not, should I give her space when this happens? She doesn't seem to realise when she's doing it but I feel if I brought attention to it, it'd make things worse.

"How severe does it need to be before it's BPD? For the past couple years I always thought I was type 2 bipolar but I'm starting to notice a lot of the symptoms of BPD. I've been talking to this girl lately and I find myself constantly picking apart her words and wondering if she's annoyed at me. I saw her recently and every 5 minutes I was wondering if I'd done something wrong and I kept wanting to ask if everything was all good. 

I match with a lot of the other symptoms (impulsivity, mood swings, boredom/emptiness, always changing my goals, etc) and those silly online quizzes seem to think I could be a candidate. 

However, my ex has BPD and has a long history of suicide attempts and self harm and I found it extremely difficult to deal with her outbursts and mood swings. I am nothing like this and have had long and healthy relationships in the past. 

I'm 21. Is it possible that BPD is just starting to show itself now? Is it likely they're just fleas I picked up from my ex that will pass with time? I'd say apart from the past 2 years of rampant drug abuse, I'm pretty functional. 

I guess I'm just wondering how bad does it really need to be before it's classed as a disorder? No doubt everybody shares some of the symptoms of BPD but I'm just not sure where the line is and which side of it I'm on.

"It takes all the running...... I’ve spent a few months since my diagnosis stumbling around desperately looking for answers, reasons and a thread of hope to cling to and help me come to terms with BPD and how it defines me. I stumbled randomly upon this blog/article with the hope that I’d find something useful and interesting, it’s taken me a while since I finished reading to process just how devastating it is to be so fully understood, yet written off so completely.

http://gettinbetter.com/casanova.html

I exhibit so many of these traits, I’m the unwilling puppeteer in a rigged show. I’m considering ending my relationship with my partner and isolating myself from my support team, it’s time to end the denial and perhaps accept that the battle is lost and that I’m better off alone.

It’s just so utterly painful to read, as a borderline male I’m consumed by its stark and painful assessment of my behaviours which I’ve been in denial of for too long. 

I think I need to be alone. It feels like it would be a kindness to everyone I know, I just need to be brave enough to do it.

"Need Help Dealing With Distance Hi. I’ve been struggling with BPD in the relationship over the past year. It’s gotten too far for my partner, mainly because of issues I’ve had with being completely honest. She needs space, and I’m having trouble being okay with that.

In addition she’s also said she can’t see herself with me right now- that she could see a real possibility of us being together in a year or so after I’ve collected myself (I’ve made significant progress in therapy over the past year,) when I might be ready to be vulnerable in a relationship without the stuff that made it hard. She isn’t promising anything and also doesn’t want me to just wait around because that would prove I haven’t found a way to be okay with myself.

She’s my best friend and I admire her art and she admires mine. She said I’m the most special person she could ever meet but that that doesn’t mean we’re right for each other right now.

I really feel like I need to give her space, but I don’t know if we should continue being friends with that space because she and I don’t know what would be best for us: Should I distance myself to see how much we miss each other, or should I stay her friend since we enjoy our company and see if maybe seeing me behaving in a stable way around her would get her to see me romantically again?

Sorry if my thoughts are scattered, my heartbeat keeps racing and I’m trying to exercise a lot of control to keep myself from acting impulsively or from panicking.

"Boredom in relationships? Is there a way to work around it? Hey guys!

So, as the title says, this post is about boredom in relationships.

Currently I'm (NB/25) in a relationship with an amazing guy (M/24), we've been together for 3 months, and he's been super understanding and positive and he's just awesome. During the beginning of the relationship he was the love of my life, and a month or so later, that feeling died entirely and I started wanting things with other people.

I told him all of this, so he knows what's going on, knows that it has to do with my BPD, and tries to be understanding, but it's destroying him (understandably!)

So I turn to this subreddit, which has helped me in the past. Do you guys have any experience with this? Do you have any coping mechanisms?

Essentially, I started pursuing other people at work. Never with the intent to cheat, just to flirt, get that hype and intensity again. Once that went sideways with someone who quickly turned into an fp and then an ex-fp in a matter of days, my feelings for my boyfriend returned and it's like a cloud disappeared.

It's worrying, because I'm 100% sure the feeling of boredom will return in the future and I'll try to pursue someone who is ""hotter"" or ""more exciting"" or whatever, despite rationally knowing that my boyfriend is perfect for me. My brain is just telling me that stability is stagnation and stagnation is boring.

I'd also like to note that people have suggested I try and spice things up with my boyfriend somehow, but when these things happen, I essentially have no desire to be with him anymore. I only stay because I don't want to hurt him, and I know that it's a passing thing.

Anyway, I'd *really* appreciate any ideas or coping mechanisms you may have!

"Who are we? I was at my psychologist's maybe two weeks ago and I looked at her and asked to tell me honestly what's wrong with me.

She said I go to extremes often, don't have balance. 

I said, bpd?

She smiled. 

I've been suspecting for a long time anyway. I know it's not asperger's that's my issue. I wish it was just that. 

I like getting high on ideas. I like seeing that perspective that illuminates the nature of the entire problem or brings it to some other realm that no one thought of because the leaps in logic were too great. 

I like math because it allows you do all that, it allows you to see different perspectives to the same thing. Most people wouldn't characterize it that way but then most people think math is all about techniques for solving equations. No, it's about the ideas. The perspectives, the connections. 

But I haven't been able to express myself through math to the world because of my issues. I sell myself short every single time because something happens and I feel like abandoning it all. Only a few people know my true ability in the area. 

But I think that's what I want to focus on. It seems like people in the bipolar/borderline/schizophrenic camp (psychotics in other words) have gifts. And I know some people might say that I'm just equivocating but it seems like the way our brain is structured allows us to make leaps in fields that others are not able to make. And again, really, this is not an exaggeration. Some of us have received recognition like James Joyce, Nietzsche, Grothendieck, Godel and others while others among us, the majority of us don't get to express ourselves in a manner that society deems receptive such that everything else about us gets cast aside. 

For myself, what I hate about myself, that I constantly see myself from a third person point of view, I know is what gives me my ""abilities"". And I would say it is the case for the rest of us too. 

I've tried fighting myself but have now stopped or plan to do so anyway. There are bad days when the locus of projection, so to speak, is myself but then there are good days when the locus of projection is oriented rightly, where I can make connections in the things I might be interested in at that moment. 

So, I ask of you guys, what is it that serves as the dual to your ""illness"". What is the silver lining beneath the cloud of your ""illness""?","The expanded size of the tensor (559) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.  Target sizes: [1, 559].  Tensor sizes: [1, 514]"
"I just found out I had BPD, what do I need to know? I'm reading as much as I can, and am seeing a professional. From my understanding, it stems from not loving myself enough, needing external validation constantly, and not being able to accurately judge my emotions and relationships.

I just exited a relationship, where I unknowingly hurt the person I loved through my disorder. I knew the yelling was wrong, but I thought it came from a place of ""valid"" wrong doings.

There is no justification to treat someone you love that way, and it is f-ing scary.

I mostly understand where my disorder stems from, and what steps I need to take for myself to live with it. The drugs and alcohol fuel my disorder, and my disorder leads me to drugs and alcohol due to feelings of abandonment and being unloved\loving myself. I'm no longer drinking or drugging, but now I know there's this part of me that can hurt people without even knowing I am.

I CONSTANTLY seek pitty. CONSTANTLY. My exgf\love of my life broke up with me, crying infront of my eyes, and I couldn't stop repeating ""Im sorry"" then talk about my pain. I am out of control. I attribute it to additional stressors in my life, hormonal imbalances, family issues, financial issues, and more.

I constantly split. You're with me or not. There's no in between.

I want to be able to have a healthy happy life. I'm working towards it. Independence.

I accept my disorder. I never knew what was wrong with me.

What other additional resources are out there?

Edit: title says had, because I realize this disorder has wreaked havoc on every single relationship in my life. Family. Friends. Lovers. I love people then abuse them without any sense of understanding.

With roommates- 

I charm the shit out of them. Sometimes they trust me so much ill get the key first day, dont need to sign a lease, not need to prove income etc. Ill move in and be my giddy and entertaining self with them. Its great, they allll think im their bff. Then, they start asking to hangout, ill decline or cancel last minute. Then... I hate them. They annoy the fuck out of me. When they knock on door, i dont answer. I avoid and ignore them. If they stop me to talk on my way out, ill get visually angry and annoyed, its very intimidating and scary for them. Then i start ignoring them completely, wont even say hi or bye. Then i lock myself in my room, or rush out the door fast to leave so i dont see anyone. Id wait hours 4 roommates to leave just so i could leave to go to the bathroom or something. Id hear their voices outside my door in kitchen and just get sooo agitated. I feel intense anxiety 247 hiding in my room, scared to see them, communicate etc. Id be like ok im gonna sprint to bathroom in 5 now 10 now 15. 

Happens everytime. Deff roots from upbringing, you can't even imagine.. trust me. Now im in a bad situation.. I havent lived with a family since 18yo. I dont go to family functions or ANYTHING,  i do what i want. I cant be around them or parents. After so long of living alone, im totally living on the outs of society. I dont know how to relate or even fake normalcy anymore. So, i went to sleepover my bfs house who lives with parents still. He is very close with them and the house is small and crowded. I got triggered the whole drive there. I ran to his room and locked myself in THERE for 8 hrs till he got back from work. His family thought it was weird and i could hear everything. I was so scared someone would try nd come in. There was just a thin door separating us all. I was anxious the whole time about how id have to say bye when i leave.. and how messed up it is just to run out, not sit down or chat for a few min. My boyfriend felt awkward but understands me. I was so quick nd rude when i said bye. I know its WEIRD. Worst part is, im homeless as of march 1st and he offered me to live with his family. 

Being neglected, having no friends and having gone NC, im free. I do what i want, minute to minute. No supervision, no one to check in with. No calls to answer. Nothing.

Lying about horrible things? I think my BPD has gotten worse over the years and one thing I can’t seem to kick is lying about not only stupid trivial things but about really messed up things. Like I can’t tell if it is part of the manipulation aspect or part of the abandonment aspect but does anyone else struggle with this or has anyone possibly over come this aspect of the disorder?

"I’m not sure what to do about previous diagnosis? So a few years ago in high school (I was 17 or maybe 18), my mom made me see a therapist because I was very emotionally unstable, mostly depression and anxiety. I don’t really remember my therapist discussing borderline personality disorder with me or anything about a diagnosis but later my mom told me she had talked about the disorder with her and my therapist thought I had it. (I also remember my mom buying a book “walking on egg shells” about living with someone that has bpd).

I’ve always brushed off the diagnosis though..I was sick of being dragged to countless therapists and psychiatrists &amp; I didn’t like this one. So I am 23 now though and I’m doing a lot worse. I don’t want to self diagnosis...I don’t know if it’s technically self diagnosing...but I do think she was right about me having Bpd. All the symptoms are exactly what I’ve been going through and struggling with for a very long time. 

I currently see a psychiatrist, but I haven’t mentioned anything about Bpd or how bad my mental health has been (past or present) and I really don’t want to. I take antidepressants, but I just don’t want a diagnosis from my current psychiatrist to affect any other medication I’m prescribed. I don’t know what to do..I don’t know what kind of help I need and I’m kinda scared to go back to therapy. Should I just not worry about an official diagnosis or...

"Providing Help &amp; Seeking Hope I’m new to this world – please forgive my ignorance of proper terminology etc. I’ve reached a point at which I don’t know where to turn, and I’m looking for short-term advice and long-term perspective.


Some background – last summer, my significant other started seeing a therapist, and was initially diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, along with bipolar 2. After months more of therapy, the diagnosis changed to borderline personality disorder (still with anxiety). A few months ago (December), her work schedule made it impossible to continue seeing the therapist.  I have observed a dramatic decline since that point.


Thankfully none of the more harrowing symptoms have manifested – no self-harm, no suicidal thoughts. However, she has begun to experience increasingly severe paranoia (believes people are listening to our conversations, have hacked her computer etc). She has increasingly begun to try and convey her thoughts and feelings through obtuse analogy, which I cannot understand and she will not explain.  So far the damage caused by this paranoia is not catastrophic – she is suspicious of her friends, but has not yet done irreparable harm to relationships. By far the biggest obstacle is that she has come to suspect her former therapist has been ‘compromised’, and is thus deeply resistant to seeking help again (and does not believe she needs it). From my perspective, she is on a destructive path, and while my best efforts may slow the descent, I see heartache and trauma as unavoidable conclusions. 


What I’m looking for advice on is how I can be supportive and get her and us off of this destructive path. I can’t force her to seek help, and I’m at a loss as to how to move forward. In the last months, I have tried pushing us towards healthy habits (eating, sleeping, exercise etc.), and promoting mindfulness and positivity.  I can’t think of anything beyond professional help at this point, and that is met with such resistance. I don’t know what to do. 


The other thing I’m looking for is perspective on the future – I don’t expect or need a ‘normal’ life, but can there ever be stability? Am I going to deal with these same issues a decade from now? Does this ‘mellow’ with age, or become more extreme?


Thanks in advance for your thoughts.

"Why do I have such a huge problem with sex? Does anyone relate to this? TW - talking about sex

Diagnosed with BPD a year or two ago and have been in treatment ever since, I just have this one big problem (along with my heroin addiction), other than that, I’m doing very well. I haven’t even told my therapist because I’m so ashamed.

I just feel so undesirable sometimes. I just feel SO ugly when I compare myself to porn stars and celebrities. I’m actually objectively attractive, I just feel so ugly when I compare myself. I have a boyfriend of 1.5 years, I’m 21, he’s 27. I have sex with him but he seems to have enjoyed sex more early on the relationship and mostly only cares about doing romantic things. When he has sex with me, I think he sees it as “making love”. Early in the relationship, it was more of “fucking” and I kinda miss that.

I feel like he could watch porn anytime and the thought of how there’s so many better looking girls out there just makes me rarely wanna have sex. I don’t think he watches porn anymore, we live together. When i have sex with him (or when i had sex with others in the past), I dont give a shit about my own pleasure, I just wanna be the best ever, I’ll do anything to make the guy think I’m incredible. I never want guys going down on me, I can pleasure myself if I wanna feel good but sex isn’t about feeling good/love/whatever. Ever. It’s about feeling desired, having someones full attention, being good enough at something. I don’t think I have a sex drive or tbh I don’t even know what that is. I just have a “I want to feel desired” drive. 

I just dont understand how people “make love”. As long as I feel uglier than porn stars, I could never. I have sex with my bf and I just think “yep he’s imagining I’m this or that porn star because I’m just so ugly” and I have to try really hard to only focus on him so I can be better than everyone else. I have to be better than that porn star in his mind. 

I watch porn, but I also hate it too. I hate myself for watching it. Sometimes I see sometimes that reminds me of something my boyfriend would like and I literally start crying. That’s why I only watch things I know my boyfriend wouldn’t like. I’m turned on by everything he wouldn’t like. Not just my boyfriend, but in the past with other guys

I just want to die thinking about this honestly I seriously cant. I dont know why I feel this way about sex fucks sake I just wish I was normal. 

I’ve been with so many guys for someone who wants to die thinking about sex. Before my boyfriend i’d use tinder and meet up with someone new every week (i’m not exaggerating). I stopped counting a long time ago but the number is really high. Sometimes I have the urge to just to sleep with another guy and cheat (I would absolutely never do that, it’s just an urge) because maybe someone will make me feel good about myself. and the shitty thing is, every guy in the pst including my boyfriend has certainly seemed like they desire me and think I’m attractive but IT’S NEVER GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME.

I wasn’t sexually abused or anything so why am I like this? Is this a part of my BPD? Does anyone relate? Please someone relate lol I fee so alone

"A glimpse at What my bpd looks like 

Im 19
I wish I knew how to fix myself I feel so stuck in this mindset. I’m so tired of going through these good and bad phases I just want to be normal. I would kill to think normal thought and have normal emotions. Everyday is so unpredictable and it’s scary as fuck. I have medications but I always forget to take them even though they are the only thing keeping me sane. I wish I could stick to a routine but it’s like one day in seeing the world from this good happy perspective that wants to live a healthy life then the next I’m thinking fuck it who cares I’m probably dying young anyways because I’ll end up accidentally committing suicide. That’s another thing I use suicide a lot for attention. I love overdosing and having people pay attention to me for once. I love being admitted to the icu and being poked with needles and having my family and boyfriend care. Well at least that worked the first few times. It’s kind of just normal to hear that I ODed now since I do it at least once every couple months. Honestly I don’t do it on purpose though I don’t mean to at all it just happens when I get bad and stop taking my meds for too long. It’s weird because the stupidest shit will trigger it. Like the other night I was at work. I work with my boyfriend and I asked him to please mop for me while I counted money so we could close fast but he didn’t feel like it and so he told me he’d meet me in the car. This fucking flipped the switch it ruined the entire day for me. Then as I was mopping the mop fucking broke so I threw that shit on the floor and left. On the way home my emotions started to go wild and I sobbed the whole ride home which isn’t unusual I do it every day. I asked my boyfriend if he really cared or loved me because i get the feeling he really doesn’t and is lying because he feels sorry for me all because he wouldn’t mop. He tells me yes but that’s not enough reassurance for me my thoughts tell me I should jump out of the car but I know better than to do that. I just want to stop feeling sad. We make it home and I’m still crying we are parked outside and I’m crying my eyes out yelling help me. I ask my bf why he won’t do anything then he tells me what am I supposed to do o don’t know how to help you. I then explain what my thoughts are at that moment. I tell him that I’m scared of losing him like I have lost everyone else. We started arguing  because I still feel like he’s lying. I told him I should run in front of a car on the busy highway just feet away from our apartment. He told me that if I keep up my ways that he may one day stop caring. I get furious and tell him I fucking hate my life as I get out of the car and dart towards the road. I remember time felt slow I heard him screaming my name but I kept running for some reason I didn’t care anymore. I wanted to make him pay for what he said. I stopped but he was right behind me and pushed me out of the road. I realized I didn’t want to die. We went inside and he held me and told me things were ok until I stopped crying then we smoked weed till I felt better. I realized how much I love him and how much he loves me and I things felt ok again. But then I started to feel guilty. I started seeing that I was a terrible person taking advantage of yet another person just trying to help me. I eventually fell asleep then woke up the next morning. Mornings are always my favorite because the day isn’t good or bad yet and I love waking up to my bf and kissing him on the cheek. I feel like i have to make him feel loved because I know what it’s like to feel unloved all the time and I don’t want anyone else to feel that. I’m also scared of losing him. An hour goes by and I start feeling sad again. I started remembering the night before and I feel guilty again. I wake my bf up and tell him I need to go to my moms house ASAP. He drops me off because he now has to go cover my 9 hour shift. My mom knows I feel bad and asks if I’ve taken my meds which I haven’t been. She knows I tend to do that a lot so she gives me my Effexor and a trazedone so I can sleep and let it pass. I woke up later around 7 feeling normal again (for now anyways) I asked my mom to drop me off with my bf again at our work. I get really anxious if I’m not around him. I walk in and I apologize to my boss for having another episode he understands though since it’s happened before and asks when Ill be back. I told him I’d be back the next day. 

Things have been feeling pretty ok now I feel stable for now but I haven’t been taking my meds because I lost the ziplock bag I had them in. I feel better when I step back and talk about my episodes in detail it feels like I am more aware of my emotions. Anyways I just wanted to babble hope someone finds this useful.","The expanded size of the tensor (1187) must match the existing size (514) at non-singleton dimension 1.  Target sizes: [1, 1187].

"How do you tell your religious parents that you have BPD (or any mental illness for that matter) ? I'm 20yo, i live with my parents and they're pretty religious people and i believe the idea of mental illness for religious people is just total BS, If you're not feeling well then you're not close enough to God. Now that is total BS.
Anyway I had a series of events that led me to seek a psychiatrist, and i've been diagnosed with BPD. My Relationship with my parents is almost non existent, we live together but we barely talk.
I don't know if i should tell them at all, but i feel that at some point i'll have to tell them because there will come a time where i won't be able to pay for the medicine that i've been prescribed, or for the doctor's fee. I don't even know if i'll be able to hide taking medicine from them.
I really hope someone would tell me how to go on about this.

"BPD Sponsor Would anybody be interested in a BPD sponsor system similar to the 12-step programme? 

I was thinking how useful it would be to ‘match’ with someone who is also in recovery. We could encourage each other, share skills and perhaps occasionally call on each other in difficult moments to get another perspective. 

A little about me - I’m a 25 year old woman, living in London and doing a PhD. I’m in a DBT course and currently learning lots about mindfulness / Buddhism.

"FP/boyfriend told me we aren’t in a relationship &amp; is currently sleeping with another woman. I’ve been having the worst four days and today was by far the hardest. I was informed by my supposed boyfriend that we aren’t in a relationship at all (it’s a bit complicated but we broke up in January, were friends with benefits for a while, and then we were supposedly in an open relationship) and after he made no effort to see me today, he invited an incredibly awful woman over and they’re having sex. She’s 23 and has no personality aside from trying to be the ”thicc goth gf” but failing. She also dressed up as the Columbine shooters for halloween last year. 

I guess I just don’t understand why he would pass up me for her. Not to brag, but I was a pretty fire gf. He and I get along incredibly well and I’m one of few people that’s on the same intellgence level as him so we have great conversations. He’s also told me himself that I’m one of the most active sexual partners he’s had. So I’m just not sure why he wants to ignore me. 

I’m incredibly upset about this, as he’s been my FP for almost a year. I’ll split on him and be aggressive in texts when he isn’t texting back but the second he hits me back up or calls me I immediately just want to be forgiven. All of my friends are telling me I should just ghost him for a bit to try and make him see what he’s missing. I’m just not sure if I can actually ghost him though. I’m not sure I have the willpower.

"Just need some support (long post)
It's almost 1 in the morning here and I'm up crying. I had planned out Valentine's day with my so and I was super excited to spend time together and cook them a meal and do cute stuff. The usual.
My so comes home as I clear everything out to start cooking and decides to have us test drive a borrowed car that we have for the day. We aren't getting a new car anytime soon. It's just for fun. I had voiced that I wanted to do cute things, flowers, coming together, spending time with pets, etc and they were like ""ok we can stay home I guess"". I didn't want them to feel like garbage (I guess a new car for a day was my surprise...?) so I say we can do whatever they have planned. 
Nothing is planned. We have this car and no place planned. I don't do well with sudden changes of plans where the plan is vague and I don't know what's happening. It gets confusing and kind of scary. Anyways so we go to the mall with no real intent on buying anything. I just got more and more disappointed because the whole staying home and giving each other treats and whatever seemed more fun and laid back. I found out I got rejected for a job and that hurt too. I just felt like I was being dragged along but I tried to have fun...
We talked about it later because my so could sense I was disappointed. I decided to be honest and say yes, I was disappointed on top of being overwhelmed by a change of plans and I had all my feelings building up and I was trying to keep myself together. 
My so loses it. Like I have never seen my so cry. Ever. My so says that nothing they do ever seems to work for me, I'm always miserable, why can't anything make me happy, etc. I am just absolutely devistated. I felt like a piece of shit making them feel like that but I also felt upset that I couldn't be honest that changing plans suddenly was absolutely overwhelming and the rejection from the job was sticking me too. I try so hard to explain what's happening in my head and I can't even keep myself together at this point. We came to a resolution point after a while but it's not like it didn't hurt at all.
I'm still crying over it. I made my fucking beautiful patient so cry and feel unappreciated because of my mental illness and how overwhelmed I was. I just feel like a trash bag and I'm not worthy of them or their time... I'm just so distraught right now. I'm a mess and hoping they don't wake up to see this because I can't hurt them anymore than I have already...

"Codependent “cyclothymic/bipolar spectrum” individual with questions for those of you affected with Borderline Personality Disorder disclaimer: im not seeking a diagnosis from any of you. (i would only leave such claims to medical “professionals”). im looking for trends amongst this community’s illness that may be prominent in my dysfunctional lifestyle so that i can seek more effective help for once in my life. I need professional help. any of your input is greatly appreciated, thank you for taking the time to read my post.

Hello. I’ve been treated for bipolar spectrum illness for almost 3 years. Ive been suicidal since i was 12. I’m 18. 

I feel like i’ve been misdiagnosed for the reason that I have extremely codependent tendencies. Dangerously on and off in my relationship, anger and love in constant battle that destroys my life. Literally feeling like dying without her. Then wanting to never see her again. Taking sleeping pills when she wont talk to me. Blocking her when she triggers me.

In my research behind codependent relationships (online lectures and books by psychotherapists specializing in codependent relationships) I have found that an individual with any type of personality disorder is usually a key ingredient for a codependent relationship. A dysfunctional person, one who denies being ill and refuses treatment (me).

my parents dont force me to have a pdoc/therapist because one is absentee and the other is sort-of easy to fool. I prefer to hide my problems because theres so much social stigma around being a mentally dysfunctional male.

I’ve been hospitalized for suicide
had drug and alcohol problems
major depressive episodes
cyclothymic hypomania (never full mania)
been on paxil, seroquel, lamictal, xanax, zoloft (prescription) 
i no longer take medication because i would abuse it to try to hurt myself, and i had a lot of nightmarish side effects. I also believe that my old psychiatrist was over medicating me which has made me distrustful of psychiatrists and medication. This psychiatrist (one ever saw him) was retiring and didnt care about me, i dont know why i went to him. i was too young to understand what a good psychiatrist was like. I use extensive exercise and bad coping mechanisms to calm myself down when needed.

my question is, do you find any similarity between your problems in mine. were any of you called manic-depressed before you were called BPD? is codependency something that most of you struggle with?

what do you do to cope? meditation, exercise, psychiatric medication?

seriously, any input is really appreciated. I need the help of a therapist and I need to stop lying to myself about being normal. i need to stop denying treatment. again, Thank you for taking the time to read my post. it means a lot to me, to hear from people who know first-hand what it is like to have BPD.

"This year is the year I get better Back in November of last year, in the midst of personal chaos for the umpteenth time, I decided enough was enough and I wanted to fix myself. 

Today is February 16th and I feel like I've just barely gotten anywhere. 

I started focusing in creating myself a daily routine (wake up, feed dog, put on face, eat breakfast, shower, take medicine, make time for boyfriend, etc). and its been going okay. I feel better about organizing my life, but when I take a look at my checklist at the end of each week I'm only doing about 50% of my goals each day. Its disappointing, but I'm optimistic that its the right first move. 

I recently decided I needed to get an actual diagnosis and finally find another doctor who I can easily communicate with. My first primary doctor retired about 2 and a half years ago, and I've felt very wary about the replacement doctor. She's young and extra busy working at three separate hospitals. She is nice enough, but has a rough time following up with me and its extremely hard to talk with her directly. I always end up talking to a different nurse each time. 

I just moved to a new state after a crazy stupid melodramatic emergency situation with my fiancée's mother, whom I suspect has BPD as well, forced us to find new house and home with 72 hour notice. (Whole story is really just madness, partially of fault on my end)

The drive to my original job at my last home is over an hour away. I have struggled to get to work because of the exhausting drive and it has effected my positive outlook for this year.  I thankfully found a position with the same company down the road from my new home. I start next week. 

But I still am struggling feeling normal. I feel excessively anxious and guilty. I stay at home and try to be productive and accountable to my personal goals I set for myself each week, but I'm not even doing that all the way right. 

Next week I'm going to see my current doctor. I'm going to find the courage to ask her for a referral for a psychiatrist near me. 

I know I can beat this, but each step seems so large. 

Anybody have any advice about finally getting your shit together, diagnosed and towards normalcy?

"(22F) I wrote down my thoughts after ruining Valentine’s Day. My husband picked up Walgreens roses and a card on the way home and I spiraled. Maybe I’m just tired of gas station roses and hallmark cards. I’m tired of not feeling like the romance is dead when it’s rotting beneath our feet. Maybe I’m just tired of chalky chocolates that leave behind nothing but the bitter taste of loneliness. 

I don’t remember exactly when it started to feel like this. When even the usual things stopped making me smile. If I had to try, I would say I probably have been this way long before you came into my life. If I had to try, I would say it probably isn’t your fault at all. 

Some people are born into love. They arrive and it’s already waiting for them, happy to gently hold their grasping tiny hands. But then of course, some people are born into no love at all. Nothing but silence answers their increasingly desperate cries. Lastly, there are those born not knowing if the love will stay. They timidly reach out, sure that this will be the time no one reaches back. 

So yes, maybe it’s easier to blame the gas station roses or the cheap candy, because at least it’s tangible. I can reach out and touch the plasticky petals, inhaling the stale scent of chemicals and inevitably decay that sticks in my nose and say, ‘Yes! This is surely the problem.’ It’s easier to blame something that isn’t inside you. Sometimes it’s easier to blame something else when you’re always blaming yourself.

"Successful relationship but need advice Two years ago I broke up with my ex boyfriend. I decided to try a poly relationship for the first time and got a new boyfriend. One year of a perfect relationship. He is dominate in bed and easy going outside of bed. He allows me to have a submissive fwb for my needs. So I asked my ex to join us and his response was ""Let's give it a try"". I have been talking to my ex but I do not get attached because of my current partner. We have done it many times but first time with my ex. Is this a bad idea? Is anyone here in a poly relationship? I tried being loyal to one person but I felt like I always pushed them away and I start to feel no attachment to them. Now I get the attention and needs met. My life outside and inside the relationship is good, but I feel this could make it for the better or break it. Please help!","[[{'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.3293852210044861}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.18207702040672302}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.11612359434366226}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.10787226259708405}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.08128652721643448}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.0632382482290268}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.05770566686987877}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.055377986282110214}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.04497617855668068}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.04141334816813469}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.040510665625333786}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.0323408767580986}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.029583953320980072}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.020130978897213936}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.01940082386136055}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.014365440234541893}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.014079027809202671}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.013774484395980835}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.011868723668158054}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.009475951083004475}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.005926370155066252}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0033217582385987043}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.003202300751581788}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.002272839890792966}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.0022281724959611893}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.0012346290750429034}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.0010396764846518636}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.0006108126253820956}]]"
"FP Issue My FP is my boyfriend. We're in a long distance relationship. I was going to move in with him in California (I'm from Texas) at the beginning of this year but things happened and now I'm back in Texas after spending only a few days with him in California. Ever since I've been back in Texas things have been different. We don't talk as much and I feel like he doesn't care about me as much as he used to. I know this might be me being paranoid and I know he's busy with his job, but these feelings of not being enough or being a disappointment are eating me alive. Am I overreacting? Is this something I should talk to him about?

Ps. He knows I have BPD but I don't think he knows/understands that he's my FP. He also doesn't know that I've been feeling like this, I've been too afraid to tell him.","[[{'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.3121638596057892}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.22705449163913727}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.18424007296562195}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.16019952297210693}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.12125203758478165}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.1209808960556984}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.10669302940368652}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.06674011796712875}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.03733154758810997}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.03012491948902607}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.02041378803551197}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.015488902106881142}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.013849189504981041}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.008353514596819878}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.007919742725789547}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.007483538240194321}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.005752261728048325}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.004363809246569872}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.004293586127460003}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.004227500408887863}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.004162629600614309}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.004015415906906128}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.0038834712468087673}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.003840206190943718}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.0022374303080141544}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.0019474872387945652}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.0006817052490077913}, {'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.00034369263448752463}]]"
"Question about abuse-TW Let me start by saying that I suffer from BPD.  I hope it is okay to post this here. I'm a regular but using a throwaway account. 
When I was between the ages of 5-8 I had an incident with some boys. They were about 3 years older than me. Basically, we were hidden behind a tree and I ended up with their penises in my mouth. The details and faces are fuzzy. I remember I felt like I was standing to the side watching the whole thing take place. Someone told me this was abuse. I'm just looking for any input. Thank you. I hope this wasn't triggering. I appreciate any thoughts.","[[{'label': 'gratitude', 'score': 0.9158542156219482}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.748051106929779}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.11305391788482666}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.0874844416975975}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.04597890377044678}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.04542896896600723}, {'label': 'remorse', 'score': 0.04064836725592613}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.016736799851059914}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.014408485032618046}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.013149023987352848}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.012962025590240955}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.012779619544744492}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.009980883449316025}, {'label': 'relief', 'score': 0.009867175482213497}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.008847936056554317}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.006168378051370382}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.005590113345533609}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.005410568322986364}, {'label': 'pride', 'score': 0.005266954656690359}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.004180544521659613}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.00390472705475986}, {'label': 'grief', 'score': 0.003606019541621208}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.002585203852504492}, {'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.0025395983830094337}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.0022924586664885283}, {'label': 'disgust', 'score': 0.001826913096010685}, {'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.0016638189554214478}, {'label': 'embarrassment', 'score': 0.00136963848490268}]]"
"Support through dark times I made throwaway to post this yesterday, but it never showed up (maybe because the account was so new?), so I'm trying again with my main (yet still anonymous) account. Apologies if this is frowned upon. 


I’m new to this world – please forgive my ignorance of proper terminology etc. I’ve reached a point at which I don’t know where to turn, and I’m looking for short-term advice and long-term perspective.


Some background – last summer, my significant other started seeing a therapist, and was initially diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, along with bipolar 2. After months more of therapy, the diagnosis changed to borderline personality disorder (still with anxiety). A few months ago (December), her work schedule made it impossible to continue seeing the therapist. I have observed a dramatic decline since that point.


Thankfully none of the more harrowing symptoms have manifested – no self-harm, no suicidal thoughts. However, she has begun to experience increasingly severe paranoia (believes people are listening to our conversations, have hacked her computer etc). She has increasingly begun to try and convey her thoughts and feelings through obtuse analogy, which I cannot understand and she will not explain. So far the damage caused by this paranoia is not catastrophic – she is suspicious of her friends, but has not yet done irreparable harm to relationships. By far the biggest obstacle is that she has come to suspect her former therapist has been ‘compromised’, and is thus deeply resistant to seeking help again (and does not believe she needs it). From my perspective, she is on a destructive path, and while my best efforts may slow the descent, I see heartache and trauma as unavoidable conclusions.


What I’m looking for advice on is how I can be supportive and get her and us off of this destructive path. I can’t force her to seek help, and I’m at a loss as to how to move forward. In the last months, I have tried pushing us towards healthy habits (eating, sleeping, exercise etc.), and promoting mindfulness and positivity. I can’t think of anything beyond professional help at this point, and that is met with such resistance. I don’t know what to do.


The other thing I’m looking for is perspective on the future – I don’t expect or need a ‘normal’ life, but can there ever be stability? Am I going to deal with these same issues a decade from now? Does this ‘mellow’ with age, or become more extreme?
Thanks in advance for your thoughts.
